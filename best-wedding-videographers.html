Wedding coverage no longer begs the question of whether you'll have a videographer, but rather, which talented video team you'll collaborate with. And when we at BAZAAR Bride are asked to refer a filmmaker, we're most likely recommending a name from this shortlist.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The best videographers collaborate seamlessly with your photographer, planner, designer, stylist, and other members of your creative team. They understand when and where to utilize drone footage, edit your wedding with music and a style that speaks to your event's look and feel, and ensure the film feels cohesive and consistent with the look of your photographs. True pros understand that photography and cinematography aren't two distinct teams on the wedding day—despite their (most likely) being two separate businesses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The talents on this list understand collaboration, attention to detail, and the sophistication required to create and deliver the best of the best.

We want our films to evoke the genuine emotions that our couples experience on their wedding day. Not just how things looked on the outside, but how every single moment felt on the inside.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Approach</strong>: Our goal is to create entirely unique and unforgettable films that are specific to each couple. Artistic inspiration is paramount, so we limit the amount of weddings we film in order to give clients our absolute best. Most importantly, we want to build a connection with our couples so they feel totally relaxed in front of the camera, and know that we have a personal investment in them and how their films turn out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Expert Advice</strong>: It may sound obvious, but remember to be in the moment. You've spent so much time and energy planning every last detail, now is the time to relish in it. And nothing makes for more beautiful imagery than real life emotions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Weddings of Note</strong>: Between top tier athletes, artists, and entrepreneurs, our couples are hosting truly distinctive events all over the world. We recently filmed a wedding that had celebrations in three countries (Hong Kong, Bagan, and India) in just 10 days. The film quickly went viral and was featured on national TV shortly after its release.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://sculptingwithtime.com/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CONTACT rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">CONTACT</a></p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">/</h2><h2 data-node-id=48 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>LE RÊVE FILMS</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Look</strong>: We mix a combination of bright and natural imagery when telling the stories of our couples.

I strive to achieve a universe where everything, including my music choices, tell a story that translates my vision of the wedding to film—with a little "French touch" on top of it all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=60 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Approach:</strong> The most important thing for me is to create a connection and a bond with my brides and grooms, so that on the day there is a trust and a sense of calm. My motto is always to be myself whatever the circumstances, be very professional, and respect the dress code and the planning so that everything goes smoothly. Last but not least, my approach is to have fun, and keep enjoying capturing those unforgettable moments for my clients.<strong></strong></p><p>Expert Advice: Your choice of filmmaker is essential. He (or she) will be your partner on the day when it comes to capturing your memories and emotions. The videographer will be by your side before, during the wedding, and will be responsible for the memories you'll have whenever y0u watch your film. Choose a talent whose style and point of view resonates with you.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Weddings of Note:</strong> I recently filmed the wedding of Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas. This event was just amazing and it was four days long. I do a lot of international weddings from New Zealand to Morocco, and throughout Europe and far-away islands. It's given me the opportunity and the inspiration to play within my own style to capture the best in each event. My clients are demanding, distinguished, fun, and have spectacular attention to detail. They are often artists, creative people, and from all over the world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://pascaldelefilmaker.com/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CONTACT rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">CONTACT</a><br></p><h2 data-node-id=63 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">/</h2><h2 data-node-id=64 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>ELLIE CONNELL<br></strong>of Reeling Films</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Look: </strong>My style is for the couple that (think they) don’t want a wedding video. I started out using exclusively super 8 film, and now that I shoot mostly digital I strive to retain the same emotive, dreamy, perfectly-imperfect look that a handheld evokes. It’s stolen moments and happy accidents that feel human and may seem effortless, but I’m actually hyper-focused on capturing the day through my lens.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=68 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Approach: </strong>I just rock up, try to be invisible, and look for the emotion. I edit all my own films because I trust my intuition. I know how a woman wants to be seen and which scenes are an absolute dream. This is also when I fall in love with everyone's families, friends, and obsess over all the guests' outfits and dance moves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Expert Advice: </strong>Be kind to your mom and dad. On your wedding day she is looking at you with the same tear-filled, adoring eyes she had when she looked down at your crib, and it makes my heart jump. Give her hand a squeeze, hug them extra hard, or just sneak a quick pat on the back. In 30 years, you will cherish seeing it far more than your amazing shoes on a windowsill.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=70 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Weddings of Note: </strong>All my clients are VIPs and insanely wonderful human beings that have incredible taste, I go bananas over each and every one.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=71 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.reelingfilms.com/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CONTACT rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">CONTACT</a></p><h2 data-node-id=72 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">/</h2><h2 data-node-id=73 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>STORYBOX CINEMA</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=75 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Look</strong>: We specialize in merging a documentary style with cinematic finesse to tell the story of your wedding in a timeless manner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=76 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Approach</strong>: Our clients say that they feel like friends!

The people they have invited are center stage alongside them. The end result is a cinematic film that utilizes shots obtained without direction, which is very important to creating an authentic film.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=85 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Approach: </strong>Our number one goal is creating something that will be valuable to our couples and their families for decades. Our work is very story and music driven; a "pretty" video is great, but our approach is to dig much deeper, represent the incredible party it really was, the incredible people that were there, and the incredible setting, fashion, and decor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=86 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Expert Advice: </strong>Watch a ton of films from all different studios when you are looking for a cinematographer. Because the medium of motion picture is so powerful you will end up either loving or hating your film, so it's important to know what you like. The challenging thing about video is that there's no way to "skim" through it in order to choose quickly— watch films from beginning to end. When you find a studio that resonates with you, remember that you will love your own film 100x more than the others on their site.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=87 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Weddings of Note:</strong> Chance the Rapper, Riker Lynch, Marcus Lemonis, Aimee Carrero, Keyshawn Johnson, Champ Bailey, Matt Stafford, Sydel Curry, Roselyn Sanchez, and more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=88 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elysiumproductions.com/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action=CONTACT rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">CONTACT</a></p><h2 data-node-id=89 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">/</h2><h2 data-node-id=90 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>PEYTON FRANK</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=92 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>The Look</strong>: My wedding films are romantic, emotional, and bespoke.
