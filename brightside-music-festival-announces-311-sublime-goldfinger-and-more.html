Summer comes early with the Brightside music lineup’s good-time vibes that include <strong>Sublime, 311, Goldfinger, Story of the Year, Face To Face, Save Ferris, Unwritten Law, Zebrahead,</strong> and more.</p><p>Brightside will include one of the first announced festival appearances for the recently reunited Sublime – featuring original members Bud Gaugh, Eric Wilson, and Jakob Nowell (son of original singer Bradley Nowell) – one week after the band’s Coachella performance. Sublime has sold over 18 million albums in the U.S., and their genre-defining music and cultural influence is more substantial today than ever.</p><p>In addition, the festival will offer craft beer sampling as a $10 add-on purchase, showcasing the best local, regional, and national craft beer, hard seltzer, and cider. Tickets for Brightside go on sale Friday (February 2) at 10 am ET. General Admission (GA) tickets start at $69 plus fees, and VIP tickets start at $199 plus fees. VIP tickets provide access to designated areas with shade, upgraded restrooms, and a VIP Bar. Doors open at Noon for this all-ages destination event.</p><p><strong>Event co-producer Cameron Collins of BHHP</strong> said, “This is one of those events where you just get that feeling something special is about to happen. The stars aligned perfectly on this festival, and I’m stoked to be doing this with Sublime, 311, Goldfinger, and the whole lineup in Orlando, Florida. The energy from the crowd singing along to every word at this one is going to be electrifying! This is an exciting time for Brew Ha Ha Productions!”\</p><p>“The crazy thing is how quickly this all came together. &nbsp;It was less than two weeks from Bruce Solar at Paladin Artists telling me that Sublime wanted to play Florida to us booking the event, announcing and going on sale”. “Sublime is a magnet for other like minded artists and its going to be a special day,” added <strong>MassConcerts’ John Peters.</strong></p><p>BHHP is the nation’s most successful and respected craft beer and music festival producer. BHHP is known for its diverse, award-winning beer-centric events and music festivals across the United States, including Punk In The Park, Punk In Drublic Craft Beer & Music Festival, and the NOFX Final Tour.</p><p>With more than two decades in the industry, Massachusetts-based live events producer MassConcerts, led by John Peters, is one of the independent event producers in the Northeast, booking shows at venues across the region.
