Anticipation has been palpable ahead of the release of Unforgiven, as evidenced by the number of pre-orders.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As of April 28, the album had surpassed 1.38 million pre-orders – a more than twofold increase from Antifragile.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Unforgiven shows our determination that we will pioneer our own path without following the standard set by the world,” Kim explained during the press event.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kazuha elaborated: “We offer the tunes of diverse genres ranging from hip-hop to Latin pop, so people can enjoy our album without getting bored.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unforgiven is fronted by the lead track of the same name, which blends hip-hop and funk rhythms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We attempted to highlight our confidence in our previous releases, but this time, we tried to pull off some new genres to bring our multifaceted sides to the fore,” Huh Yun-jin noted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unforgiven features Grammy-winning American musician Nile Rodgers. This is the first time that Rodgers – who previously worked with prominent pop singers including Beyoncé and Madonna – has collaborated with a K-pop artist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I first learned about our collaboration, I was so surprised because Rodgers is the creator behind so many songs that I listened to when I was young,” Huh said. “It still feels surreal.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unforgiven also samples the main theme song from the 1966 film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It was written by Maestro Ennio Morricone, one of the greatest film composers in history.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As far as I know, it was producer Bang Si-hyuk’s brainchild to sample this song,” Sakura said. Bang is the chairman of K-pop powerhouse Hybe that runs Source Music as its sub-label.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He thought it would be a good fit for us, so he got hold of the Morricone family,” Sakura added. “I heard that his son readily allowed us to sample it.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">It was my first time to pen lyrics for a song in our albumHong Eun-chae</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Huh said she felt like she was going to Texas from New York when she heard Unforgiven. “It was also reminiscent of the scenes in a Western movie,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Le Sserafim are already one of the most successful rookie groups in the K-pop scene, but the members still have big ambitions for the future.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I hope our track can rank first on music streaming charts,” Kim said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/05/02/3ab52271-2985-4fbe-8df6-36c7b2510d41_9bf5bfbb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sakura added: “I want to hold a world tour and meet our fans across the globe.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It was my first time to pen lyrics for a song in our album,” Hong Eun-chae said, referring to “Between You, Me and the lamp post”. All Le Sserafim members took part in writing its lyrics, and Huh even participated in its production.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I will work hard so that I can participate in the creative process of more tracks in the future,” Hong added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZpuZnpnAcK3RraCcpJVkgHN9mGlucmeepHqzu9Kao6KZXae2sXnUp52oqpeew6a6jKRkqaegqHqtsYysqp6qkZu2rnnSmrBmn6KkwrF5yKerq6eUqrCmecClma6lXZuyosDUq5ysZZ6euaZ50aiboJ2iqHqiusM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
