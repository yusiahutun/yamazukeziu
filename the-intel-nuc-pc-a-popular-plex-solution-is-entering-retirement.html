Unfortunately, we must add "retiree" to this list. As reported by&nbsp;<a href=#>ServeTheHome</a>&nbsp;(and subsequently confirmed by Intel), the NUC brand is now discontinued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Intel NUC, or "Next Unit of Compute," has been at the forefront of the mini PC movement for several years. It sells fully-assembled mini PCs in several configurations, which are great for businesses or individuals who need small computers. But, more notably, Intel NUC sells small kits and individual components, which enthusiasts and hobbyists can use to build machines for specific purposes (servers being the most obvious example).</p><p>But earlier this week, Intel began warning business customers that it will "stop direct investment" in NUC. The news leaked,&nbsp;<a href=#>ServeTheHome</a> reported on the situation, and Intel published the following statement:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We have decided to stop direct investment in the Next Unit of Compute (NUC) Business and pivot our strategy to enable our ecosystem partners to continue NUC innovation and growth. This decision will not impact the remainder of Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) or Network and Edge Computing (NEX) businesses. Furthermore, we are working with our partners and customers to ensure a smooth transition and fulfillment of all our current commitments -- including ongoing support for NUC products currently in market."</p><p>Thankfully, Intel will continue to support existing NUC computers. It will also dedicate some resources to other mini PC brands (there are plenty to choose from these days). If you own a NUC PC, it should last for a long time, and similar options will be available when you need to buy a replacement.</p><p>The reasons for this change are unknown. But, to be fair, Intel is probably making the right choice. The Intel NUC brand greatly improved both the quality and public perception of small form factor computers, to the point that competition is starting to get stiff. Intel makes a profit when other brands use its technology, so why bother competing?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We see similar logic across the tech industry as a whole. Years ago, Google used its Nexus phone brand as an example of Android's capabilities, and it inspired plenty of other phonemakers in the process. And Qualcomm, a chipmaker, recently created <a href=#>a pair of AR glasses</a>&nbsp;to get industry players interested in the Snapdragon XR platform.</p><p>Anyways, Intel NUC is on the way out. If you've always wanted to own a NUC, now's the time to buy one. Or, you can shop from other mini PC makers, such as <a href=#>ASUS</a> or <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Beelink</a>.</p><p>Source: Intel via&nbsp;<a href=#>ServeTheHome</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhobnBoZX5wwMeeZKKmpJq5brrUnGSpm12WerG7z66jmqpdpbmmxIyspqWtpJ68r3nIrGSepqSav6q6xmapnqyZp7Kusc2tZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
