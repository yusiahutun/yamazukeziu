William Lind is still hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit at OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria. His status is “critical, but stable, with no prognosis as it is too early to determine.”</p><p>Lind was critically injured Monday during an assault in East Moline.</p><p>“We would like to thank the continued support from everyone in the community. This incident has had an impact on the family, first responders and community as a whole. We will provide more updates as they become available,” the release says.</p><p>East Moline Police posted Wednesday on Facebook that many people have been asking if they can make a donation to Sgt. Lind and his family. The local Illinois police union Lodge 96 has set up a Venmo account for this specific purpose.</p><p>All the donations received will go directly to his family to cover the cost of travel, meals, hotels, etc. for the duration of his hospitalization. “The outpouring of support has been incredible and we are truly thankful,” the department said. The Venmo QR code is in the picture below. Please put the subject of the donation as “Sgt. Lind.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/10/Venmo-code.jpg><p>EARLIER: “10-78, officer down.”</p><p>That was the message that went out over Rock Island County police scanners early Monday night – one of the last things any listener wants to hear.</p><p>East Moline Police Sergeant William Lind, also known as Bill or Billy, was attacked and severely injured on Morton Drive near 19th Street in East Moline. His fellow officers arrived on the scene to find him on the ground unconscious, with no suspect in sight.</p><p>“Officer down. They’re looking for a suspect. 1900 block, Morton Drive … Patient has head injury and is unresponsive, but breathing,” police communicated over the scanner.</p><p>Now he is hospitalized with life-threatening head injuries, according to police. Police departments and other residents across Illinois and Iowa are sending their well-wishes to Lind via social media – one Facebook post says “Prayers for Sergeant Lind.” That post has been shared throughout Tuesday, with some people making it their temporary profile picture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/10/Prayers-for-Sergeant-Lind-1.jpg><p>The young sergeant has been having one of the best years of his career.

Rogers is being charged with attempted murder, aggravated battery of a peace officer, and aggravated arson.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/10/Mug-Shot-Adrian-Rogers.jpg><p>Documents show Rogers was indicted by a grand jury in 1993 for staging an armed robbery at a bank in Davenport.</p><p>He’s now being held in Rock Island County Jail on a $1 million bond.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKeopJmYsm6%2FxKuenpmeqXqkvsitoJyZnGKup8DEq2SaqqOku26%2F1KynnpukqHqiwNOamqRn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
