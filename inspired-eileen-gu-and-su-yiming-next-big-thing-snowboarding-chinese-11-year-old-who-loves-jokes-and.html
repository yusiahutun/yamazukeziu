It’s the same thing that kept two-time Olympic halfpipe champion Chloe Kim out of the 2014 Sochi Games.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zhou, who loves a joke as much as she loves snowboarding, said that would just give her more time to learn bigger tricks like one of her favourite halfpipe riders, Olympic gold medallist Ayumu Hirano from Japan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/24/46db0401-e262-4e74-af40-cadcd31b401a_3646e1eb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A first snowboard lesson when still only a toddler sparked a love of the sport and her mountain surroundings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I was young, I thought the mountain was so big and so scary and so dark. But the mountain is actually alive,” Zhou said. “So, when I go snowboarding I always try to find the animal creatures in there.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then, she gives them names.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A particularly tall deer she once saw she named after Australia’s particularly tall snowboarder Scotty James, who has earned two Olympic medals in the halfpipe. An inquisitive crow she named after Hirano. And a squirrel bouncing around in the woods she named after two-time Olympic silver medallist Danny Kass.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">All part of the fun and games for Zhou, who also has designs on writing her own joke book. A particular favourite is sure to make its pages.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“How do you know if a plant is smart?” Patti Zhou said. “It has square roots.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Raised in Beijing, she and her family have now settled into Silverthorne, Colorado, where they rent a place from Norwegian snowboarder Torstein Horgmo.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asked where she’s from these days and she said: “I say that I’m from ‘Beijing, Colorado.’ Everybody’s like, ‘What?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/24/88d9aaf6-a1d5-47ec-9ec4-3d7e062764fe_b816342b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A typical morning for her during snowboarding season starts off with a bowl of her favourite Cocoa Puffs, and a trip to nearby Copper Mountain for training sessions, or just to ride. Although no session is complete without sharing some hot fries smothered in ketchup with her younger sister.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then, it’s homeschool time, where her favourite subject is “all of them”, although if pressed, history tops the list.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Watching all the action unfold at the Winter Games last February in the mountains outside Beijing, she was captivated, and motivated, by the triple corks of Hirano on his way to an Olympic gold medal in the halfpipe.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She also drew inspiration from Eileen Gu, the freestyle skier who grew up in the US but competes for her mum’s homeland of China. Gu won gold in big air and halfpipe, along with silver in slopestyle. The same sort of motivation struck while watching Su Yiming, the Chinese snowboarder who won Olympic gold in big air and silver in slopestyle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China is booming now with sports and [Su and Gu] inspired so many young people to start riding,” said Zhou, whose sponsors already include Burton, Oakley, Woodward Copper and Sun Bum.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Snowboarding isn’t the only sport where Zhou is making waves. She’s also a surfer and frequently trains at a wave pool in Waco, Texas. She said both sports are complementary to each other.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I see myself going to the Olympics in snowboarding but after snowboarding I’ll try to get there in surfing as well,” Zhou said. “Try to get a title or something.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mnKCZo65wrdGtoJyklWSAc32QbGtrZ5mjwLG10Z6bZp2ZobKmuoygrGaZnpl6tMGMsqCmoZ6ceq%2Bx161km6GXYsGptc2gZKymn6yvsK3RnaCnn12Ytaq6xKycZmlhYsamrdFmpqWcXay1sHnLqK2eq12fvKyx0maYp5w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
