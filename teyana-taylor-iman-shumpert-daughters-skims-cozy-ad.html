The family were featured prominently in the new ad, which launched on Friday, December 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/teyana-taylor-iman-shumpert-skims-kids-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>In each photo, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the family</a> looked like they were all rocking matching SKIMS onesies. The first photo featured them all in brown outfits, which looked extra fluffy and, of course, Cozy! Other than the onesies, Teyana, 30, also sported a hat, which looked like it was made from the same material as the clothes. Little Rue also rocked a headband, while her dad, 31, gave her a big smile, while<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> cradling her</a> in his arms. The pair’s older daughter also had braids, similar to her mom and dad, but she also had a variety of different colored beads at the end of her locks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/teyana-taylor-iman-shumpert-skims-kids-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The second photo featured the whole family in gray. Teyana wore a similar hat to the one she did in the brown photo shoot, but her daughters also wore matching hats. It can also be seen that the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dancing With The Stars winner</a>&nbsp;also accessorized with a gold chain during the photo shoot. The family’s last photo featured both parents cuddling up to Junie, as their younger daughter was off to the side. It looked more like they were wrapped in a blanket than wearing onesies, like in the previous shots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/teyana-taylor-iman-shumpert-skims-kids-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Teyana and Iman both also shared the photos to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their Instagram</a>s, and seemed like they were very happy with the SKIMs line. It sounds like they were both happy to get the new line of products before the holiday season. “Easily the comfiest shoot we’ve ever done lol! We all love the new Cozy collection from&nbsp;@SKIMS and will be coolin out in our matching sets for the Holidays!” Iman wrote in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his caption</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49sZq2dqZa7onnTmrClp6Jitq6tzWaqoa2dpbKzwIydmK6fmKmys7%2BMrKKipaNisLDG2GaYnWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
