Ever since its unique moniker was revealed, fans have been eager to know everything about the rapper’s pet cat.</strong></p><p>Not a lot of <a href=#>Drake</a>‘s fans know he is a dog person, too, with an inclination for the breed Akita. While one of his pooches made it to the cover of his previous album, the world came to know about his pet cat during a live stream, in the most unexpected way!</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-479285416-1024x684.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-has-a-cat-named-crodie>Drake has a cat named Crodie</h2><p>Drake hadn’t planned to introduce his pet cat to thousands of his fans during his latest live stream. But social media users are thrilled that he did, because they wouldn’t have learned about Crodie otherwise.</p><p>Drake and Roshtein came together for a stream on Kick earlier this week, when the rapper’s pet cat appeared in the background. The duo was about to make a toast when Drake turned around to point at Crodie.</p><p>When Roshtein said it’s “for all the cats”, a wordplay for Drake’s latest album “For All the Dogs”, the latter goes on to show the streamer the correct way to pronounce his cat’s name in a Canadian accent.</p><p>For the unversed, Crodie is Toronto slang for “a friend”, who would “do anything for no matter what,” according to the Urban Dictionary.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-react-to-the-pet-s-unique-name>Fans react to the pet’s unique name</h2><p>Fans think only Drake could come up with a name so eccentric for his <a href=#>celebrity</a> cat that’s also left most of them in hysterics.</p><p>“Drake having a cat named Crodie makes the world go round,” said one.</p><p>Another added: “Drake naming his cat Crodie is on brand for Toronto,” added another.</p><p>A third user commented: “Did Drake really name his cat Crodie? This man is unserious.”</p><p>“I love the way he says his cat’s name it’s so cute but like sassy at the same time.LOL,” read one comment, while another fan joked: “Okay, but we need more Crodie content. Someone tell Drake the people need this”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rapper-has-had-pet-akita-s-too>Rapper has had pet Akita’s too</h2><p>In 2016, Drake was featured alongside his pet dog Diamond for his album View’s digital booklet. Diamond was also seen in a few pictures posted to his <a href=#>Instagram</a> account with another dog named Winter.</p><p>Drake has mostly kept his pets hidden from the spotlight and an exclusive interview with a dog trainer revealed he had another dog of the same breed called Reuben.</p><p>It was reported in 2022 the rapper had welcomed a new friend into his life, but he couldn’t keep the pup with him for long owing to his busy schedule at the time.</p><p>He surrendered the puppy to dog trainer Cheri Wulff Lucas for a while until he was back from his Summer Sixteen Tour, but the former fell in love with the puppy and ended up keeping Reuben with herself.</p><p>Cheri <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> BuzzFeed: “I was just really in love with Reuben, but I wanted to keep it very professional, so I couldn’t very well say, ‘I’m going to cry if you don’t let me keep him,’.”</p><p>“But he was really open about it. Drake is a really, really nice guy. He’s very humble and very down-to-earth. It came down to just a commonsense arrangement more than anything,” she added further.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aGcLDRmqKeZZ6Wuqq6xmafoqtdpbK1ecKaq2aboqSxqrGMsJispqRivK95xZqlrGWSnruou4ycmKucXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
