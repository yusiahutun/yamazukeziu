Since Allen does not do interviews, all questions people have about her may never get responses.</p><h3>2. She enjoys travelling and doing yoga</h3><p class=align-left>Even though Martie Allen’s career in acting was not as successful as Kristy’s, they have mutual interests. In three decades, they have discovered new interests that help in strengthening their bond as a couple. Currently, they travel and do yoga together.</p><p class=align-left>Since Martie Allen and Kristy Mcnichol are no longer in active careers, they travel to different parts of the world at ease.

The worth is mainly from acting and private businesses. In the recent past, the couple has also ventured into training actors.</p><p class=align-left>Since they have lived together for three decades, it is impossible to calculate Martie Allen’s net worth without including Kristy’s income and properties. Their lives are intertwined, and so are their finances and worth.</p><p class=align-left>Before moving together, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kristy sold her house</a> in the early 1990s. While it was unplanned, the decision allowed them to start life on a clean slate.</p><h3>4. Martie Allen has not adopted children</h3><p class=align-left>Owing to the progressive adoption laws in the USA, most same-sex marriages can now adopt children. However, Martie Allen and Kristy have not adopted a child. They live alone in Los Angeles. While Allen and her partner have never addressed having a large <a href=#>family</a>, their decision is not related to any known reason.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bf0eb68c6acbbc01.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Iva Colter: What you should know about Mike Colter's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Due to their newfound interests such as travelling and yoga, it may be hard for them to expand their family by adopting. However, the couple is unpredictable. Because of their unpredictability, they may adopt and expand their small family.</p><h3>5. She currently lives in Los Angeles</h3><p class=align-left>Martie Allen lives in Los Angeles together with her wife. While they lived in different states before Kristy’s retirement, Los Angeles is a perfect retirement place for both of them. Even though they travel a lot across the world, they also have active businesses in Los Angeles.</p><p class=align-left>Besides their businesses, the lovebirds are in Los Angeles for two more reasons. Kristy is involved in training actors as a private tutor and, the city has one of the most vibrant acting industries in the USA. Second, the city helps them pursue other dreams, such as doing yoga. Unlike most cities, Los Angeles is home to one of the largest Yoga communities in the west.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1b90a6cb1e3f544d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is David Goggins's ex-wife?

Like in most coming out stories by celebrities, the world was curious to know her lover. In this case, people notice that Kristy was younger than her lover. However, they have a two years age difference.</p><p class=align-left>Kristy McNichols was born in September 1962, while Allen was born in January 1960. While it is hard to know whether the age difference has affected their relationship, they have been together for close to 30 years.

Allen tried acting in the 1970s</h3><p class=align-left>In her early days, Allen was interested in acting. While the details about her acting journey are scarce, she had a similar dream as Kristy.

Second, judging by her love for privacy, she may have quit acting due to personal reasons.</p><h3>8. Martie Allen came into the limelight in 2012</h3><p class=align-left>Before 2012, the world knew almost nothing about Martie Allen. While she may have created a buzz around her personality in the 1970s, it died when she decided to quit acting. However, after <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kristy’s story in 2012</a>, the media became curious about the mysterious woman.</p><p class=align-left>After so many speculations, <a href=#>gossip</a> outlets and mainstream media discovered that Martie Allen is Kristy's wife.
