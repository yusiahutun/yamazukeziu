Then they could analyse how one serving per day impacted participants.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The researchers found that consuming the actual berries makes a big difference. Study participants who ate synthetic forms of the nutrients saw no improvement in a protective pigmentation that is important for eye health.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Li, the key chemicals for the study were lutein and zeaxanthin, which “are like sunscreen for your eyes”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The higher the lutein and zeaxanthin in your retina, the more protection you have. Our study found that even in normal healthy eyes, these optical pigments can be increased with a small daily serving of goji berries.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The study found that goji berries significantly impacted the pigments, which protect against blue light and oxidants, suggesting that the berries could help improve even healthy eyes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The authors theorised that other nutrients in goji berries, such as taurine, vitamin C and zinc, could help strengthen the protective pigments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/01/27/15beac94-6602-4a1a-a0c5-ad220402bb24_ed18453d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A study out of China found similar results, but the authors said that the study had too many intruding factors – such as testing smokers and non-smokers – to be overly trustworthy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the California study finds that goji berries can help prevent AMD, the study was not designed to figure out if it could reverse the process if it had already started.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The next step for our research will be to examine goji berries in patients with early-stage AMD,” said Glenn Yiu, a co-author of the study and an associate professor at the university.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the synthetic nutrient capsules proved ineffective, the study’s goal was to compare products readily available to shoppers, so the scientists did not break down the nutrients. The authors also noted that the sample size was small, so more studies are needed to confirm the data.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The goji berry has been experiencing a global renaissance over the past few years as its health benefits have become more widely known.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While it has long been a part of diets across China, the northwest autonomous region Ningxia is said to have the highest quality versions of the fruit, according to the BBC.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Goji berries first appear in Chinese history in a book titled The Divine Farmer’s Herb-Root Classic written by a mythological ruler named Shennong, who legend says brought agriculture to ancient China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The story of Shennong was that he tested all sorts of herbs to find their health benefits, putting the information in the encyclopaedia, which is considered the oldest book about traditional Chinese medicine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While goji berries were first described in that book, no medical uses were attributed to them until the third century.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Subhuti Dharmananda, from the Institute for Traditional Medicine in the US state of Oregon, said the fruit was not widely used until the end of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0minnqegobJur9Slq66qlWTAsK%2FImqNmr5Whs6K%2BxGiYq6yZmLmme5JqbW5oYGt8qa3NnZ2upF2cvKu1jJucq6qZmsBusMCyZKSdlaXAbrvPraamnaSntrTAjJqumrE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
