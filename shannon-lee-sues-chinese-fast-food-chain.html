Bruce Lee Enterprises wants this fast-food chain to immediately stop the use of this logo and has also claimed a price of $30m (£23.1m) in compensation by Shannon Lee.</p><p>Although the restaurant has put forth a strong argument that the logo is just an image that depicts a dark-haired man who is in a martial arts pose, and was approved by the local authorities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Shannon-Lee.jpg><p>“The Real Kungfu chain’s logo is one that the company had applied for and obtained after rigorous screening by the national trademark agency, we have already been using this for 15 years.
