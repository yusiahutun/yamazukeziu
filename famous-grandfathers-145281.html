Though it might be a little jarring to see Alice cooing over his twin grandsons, the “Poison” artist said grandparenthood is one of his greatest joys.</p><p>During an interview with <a href=#>Fox’s Phoenix news station KSAZ</a> in May 2015, Alice revealed how common it is to find a Hollywood bad boy-turned family man. “The guys in the business are all family guys, almost every guy I know,” he said, noting he’s not the first rocker to become a grandpa. “I don’t care how weird they are — from <a href=#><strong>Johnny Depp</strong></a> to <strong>Rob Zombie</strong> — [they] all have kids, and they totally get it.”</p><p>That certainly is the case for Ozzy, who is a loving grandpa to several grandkids. On <a href=#>Instagram</a>, he often gives glimpses into his adventures with his grandkids, including his granddaughter Pearl. During an interview with <a href=#>97.1 The River</a>, the “Crazy Train” crooner gushed over his bond with his little one.</p><p>“Pearl is such a great experience to have,” Ozzy said in 2014, pointing out how much his life has improved since he experienced grandparenthood. “I have other grandchildren, but when I had my own kids, I was touring or in rehab. It’s a lot better environment now. I can be of service to my family.”</p><p>Ozzy’s transformation from terrifying rocker to proud grandpa has been sweet to watch, especially for the rocker’s daughter <a href=#><strong>Kelly Osbourne</strong></a>. While once speaking with U.K.’s <a href=#>GQ</a>, the former Osbournes star opened up about watching her dad’s image evolve.</p><p>“People have gone from telling me my father is a Satanist to, ‘Your dad’s really cool,’” the reality personality shared. “It’s weird spending your whole life defending somebody who suddenly one day becomes everyone’s idol.”</p><p><strong>To see a list of more former Hollywood bad boys who are now loving grandpas, scroll through the gallery below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46fmKanpah6qL7Ap5ufmaSdsrO%2FjGprbmpoZnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
