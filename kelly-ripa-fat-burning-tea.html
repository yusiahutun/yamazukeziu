On top of her healthy eating and active lifestyle habits, apparently she also relies turmeric tea before bed for weight loss. And she mixes in a little ginger for good measure!</p><p>The talk show host’s bedtime beverage was <a href=# rel=noopener>shared by</a> Dr. Daryl Gioffre, author of Get Off Your Sugar (<a href=# rel=noopener>Buy on Amazon, $16.15</a>). He helped Ripa <a href=#>tame her sweet tooth</a> and said that she “will drink a detox tea with turmeric, ginger, lemon, and black pepper at night to crush any cravings, and keep the body in a peak, strengthened state.”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How turmeric speeds weight loss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/GettyImages-1205005642.jpg><p>Along with ridding Ripa of her sugar impulses, <a href=#>one study</a> found that the curcumin in turmeric works to reduce the spread of fat throughout the body. “Weight gain is the result of the growth and expansion of fat tissue, which cannot happen unless new blood vessels form, a process known as angiogenesis,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Mohsen Meydani, DVM, PhD</a>, lead study author from Tufts University explains. “Based on our data, curcumin appears to suppress angiogenic activity in the fat tissue.”</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Want to Blast Belly Fat?

They were split into two groups with one receiving curcumin supplements and the other going without. “Curcumin appeared to be responsible for total lower body fat in the group that received supplementation,” said Meydani. They also noticed lower cholesterol and fatty liver levels in the subjects.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How ginger speeds weight loss</h2><p>As for ginger, a <a href=# rel=noopener>comprehensive review of several studies</a> showed that compounds called zingerone and shogaols within the root had promising results for higher fat-burning and lower fat storage benefits. Ginger can help <a href=#>melt away pounds</a> on its own, but combining it with turmeric for a soothing tea will clearly pack an even more powerful punch!
