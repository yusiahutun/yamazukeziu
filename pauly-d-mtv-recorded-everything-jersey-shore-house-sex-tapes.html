When he was asked if that meant there was a camera panned on them during their most intimate moments, Pauly said "you can hear them all night," referring to the cameras moving via joystick controllers.</p><p>[You can hear that part of the conversation at 18:00 in the below video:]</p><p>"We’d bring these girls home or whatever, and then all they can actually film is like alright the covers going on us so you know what happens. But they don’t actually film the act," he said, but he then clarifed that "they do" film it, "they have that footage somewhere." They just, obviously, don't air it.</p><p>And Pauly's not alone in his conviction that these tapes exist as apparently the whole cast knows about it. "Those tapes exist,” he insisted. “We always joke about it. We’re like, ‘Yo, where is that footage?"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b6c605e9-01fb-4831-a566-ed20637c7f41 data-container-ref=toofab:article:84054e22-8377-411a-9e94-70e280e6e2a3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/10/5by4/2022/01/06/1036c4b7b60746ce9324b73d03b818c5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jersey Shore's Pauly D on His 'Perfect Match' with Girlfriend Nikki Hall (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"So like that’s in a safe somewhere. Like those are our sex tapes. There’s a lot of them," he laughed. "I want to sell those some day."</p><p>Speaking of all the rampant sex and crazy fights, Pauly insisted that the show was totally unscripted when it first aired. They had a book of places they could go based on where cameras were allowed, and they couldn't go do things alone.</p><p>Now, he says "Family Vacation" is filmed more "Housewives" style. "There's no script, but they're like, 'Alright, call Vinny right now and ask him how he feels about whatever. But there's no script."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:adbbe4da-1d23-42b4-85d2-fa171f140522 data-container-ref=toofab:article:84054e22-8377-411a-9e94-70e280e6e2a3 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ed/5by4/2022/01/06/ed08c92de894415e819dc70ac102bf5d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">How 'Jersey Shore' Dealt with Ronnie's Arrest and Exit In Season Premiere</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Pauly also gave a public shout-out for Sammi to return to the show, at least for a little while. Her reason for not returning was because her ex, Ronnie, was a part of the show and that relationship got ugly, but Ronnie is taking a sabbatical.</p><p>"We're like, Sammi you should come back. Why would she say no to money?" Pauly mused. "I don't know what she's doing now; why wouldn't she come back?"</p><p>The new season of "Jersey Shore: Family Vacation" airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.</p><a id=gallery-link-4d626b8d-4346-4617-a9e5-55960b812a95 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:4d626b8d-4346-4617-a9e5-55960b812a95 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:84054e22-8377-411a-9e94-70e280e6e2a3 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/69/4by3/2022/01/27/69911641575d4263b6e979b9b156d8da_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">CBS</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2pma29fpa62uNhmm2alpKt6s7HCqKmdnZRisrex0bKroaGenHqrsdGsnLJlo528s7GMoaauq5ViwKbEjK2YqZ2jZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
