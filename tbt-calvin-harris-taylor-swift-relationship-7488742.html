Over the course of their one-year relationship, the singer-songwriter and Scottish DJ only collaborated once as co-writers on the song "This Is What You Came For," recorded by&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Rihanna</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harris was Swift's longest public relationship after a string of high-profile flings (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Joe Jonas</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Harry Styles</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jake Gyllenhaal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>John Mayer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Taylor Lautner</a>). Swift briefly dated English actor Tom Hiddleston immediately following her split from Harris before embarking on a six-year&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>relationship with Joe Alwyn</a>&nbsp;in 2017. However, in April 2023, it was announced that Swift and Alwyn&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=7>called it quits</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After his breakup with Swift, Harris reconnected with his ex-girlfriend, model Aarika Wolf, in 2018, until their breakup in 2022. He then moved on to TV and radio presenter Vick Hope, whom he has been engaged to since 2022.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at Calvin Harris and Taylor Swift's relationship.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-february-24-2015-calvin-harris-and-taylor-swift-first-meet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>February 24, 2015: Calvin Harris and Taylor Swift first meet</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Taylor Swift, Calvin Harris.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>James Devaney/GC Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Harris and Swift met backstage at the&nbsp;Elle&nbsp;Style Awards in February 2015 after being introduced by their mutual friend,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ellie Goulding</a>. And lucky for the internet, a fan just so happened to snap a photo of the exact moment it happened and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>posted on Instagram</a>. The pic showed Goulding and Swift approaching Harris, who was chatting with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Sam Smith</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Calvin is a really great mate, and he's so fantastic, and Taylor is such a cool person who I love," Goulding told&nbsp;The Sun&nbsp;(<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>via&nbsp;The Mirror</a>) about playing matchmaker. "I thought, 'They're both really awesome and both really tall, they'll be brilliant together."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goulding was right. The two immediately hit it off, and the next day, they met up at the Brit Awards and hung out at an afterparty. They reportedly saw each other again the day after that.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-april-29-2015-calvin-harris-and-taylor-swift-go-instagram-official-with-her-cats></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>April 29, 2015: Calvin Harris and Taylor Swift go Instagram official with her cats</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Instagram/@calvinharris</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While most celebrity couples make their relationship Instagram official with PDA-filled photos, Swift and Harris did things a little differently. Instead, the musical duo revealed they were officially dating, with the "Summer" producer sharing a since-deleted picture of Swift's beloved cats — Olivia Benson and Meredith Grey — to his grid,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to E!

They didn’t make it official to the public until they attended the 2015 Billboard Music Awards together in May (although the official month of their first date was March). Swift took home the award for Top Female Artist (among many others), while Harris won for Top Dance/Electronic Artist. Another winner that night? Smith, who was there when the couple first met.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-march-2016-calvin-harris-and-taylor-swift-celebrate-one-year-anniversary-on-vacation></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>March 2016: Calvin Harris and Taylor Swift celebrate one-year anniversary on vacation</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Instagram/Taylor Swift</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2016, Swift and Harris&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated their one-year anniversary</a>&nbsp;with a romantic getaway.

Initially, both opted to stay quiet, but Harris eventually went off on Swift on Twitter after the media reported that she wrote the DJ's smash single, "This Is What You Came For."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I figure if you're happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do," he wrote in a series of since-deleted tweets. "I know you're off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC but I'm not that guy, sorry. I won't allow it."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added, "Please focus on the positive aspects of YOUR life because you've earned a great one."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reflecting on his social media rant a year later, Calvin said he regretted his behavior.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was completely the wrong instinct," Harris told&nbsp;British GQ,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>per&nbsp;People</a>. "I was protecting what I see as my one talent in the world being belittled. It felt like things were piling on top of me, and that was when I snapped."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "It's very difficult when something I consider so personal plays out very publicly. The aftermath of the relationship was way more heavily publicized than the relationship itself. When we were together, we were very careful for it not to be a media circus. She respected my feelings in that sense."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm not good at being a celebrity. But when it ended, all hell broke loose," Harris added. "Now I see that Twitter thing as a result of me succumbing to pressure. It took me a minute to realize that none of that matters. I'm a positive guy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for why he and Swift broke up, Harris offered a simple explanation: "For both of us, it was the wrong situation. It clearly wasn't right, so it ended."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705urZpuRocOquoyhmKuqmah6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjKucpZmknryvv8eip2ZvZG2FeICR</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
