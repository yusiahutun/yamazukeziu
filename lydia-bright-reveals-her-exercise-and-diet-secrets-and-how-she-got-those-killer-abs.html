For me, energy produces energy and if I don't exercise I get achy and lethargic. So I’ve never massively taken my foot off the ball with fitness, because I actually enjoy it and if I don’t squeeze it in, everything else kind of starts taking a bit of a hit as well.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c7ed1fa66764-lydia-bright-daughter.jpg><p id=ebatOfvpfC3 data-wc=6>So what is Lydia’s fitness routine?</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">related</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Lydia Bright on life as a single mum as she reveals she's ready for love again" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/abaca5596667-lydia-bright-daughter-hero.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Lydia Bright on life as a single mum as she reveals she's ready for love again" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Lydia Bright on life as a single mum as she reveals she's ready for love again</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=elH7K05ocGB data-wc=88>“I usually go to the gym three times a week, and each time I run 5k, which takes about 30 minutes,” she says. “On two of those days I will do a little bit of weight training too. I vary it a bit and although that might include some ab work, I don’t pay particular attention to that area. But because I eat quite clean, I don’t have fat sitting on top of my abs, so you can see them. Also, being a mum means I’m always active.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34ef7bd0f569-lydia-bright-kitchen.jpg><p id=eNW_kNIOE3Y data-wc=18>As for her diet, Lydia prefers healthy eating to junk food, although she enjoys a glass of wine.&nbsp;</p><p id=eet4I8SZe0H data-wc=119>“I’ve always had a really good diet and now that I’m a mum I cook more and don’t eat out as much, so I’m always trying new things,” she explains. “I cook nice, healthy meals for us and Loretta eats what I eat. I was always very conscious when she was younger that I wasn’t going to cook two meals for two people and because of that she’s always been an amazing eater. I wouldn't eat turkey dinosaurs and waffles, so why would I give that her her? &nbsp;I want her to eat the best and to eat healthy. People always laugh on my Instagram because I'll put a video of her chowing down cockles as if it's popcorn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a071a02e546a-lydia-bright-meal.jpg><p id=e7WrE6JNbny data-wc=89>“We eat loads of like fruit, vegetables and pulses, like quinoa and lentils,” continues Lydia, who has just published her first children’s book, in which the mother and calf elephants represent Lydia and Loretta’s own single-parent family unit. “In the morning we have smoothies, and I sometimes skip breakfast because we’re getting ready for school. When I come back from the school run I usually have a brunch, like carrot zucchini fritters with poached eggs on top. Dinner might be teriyaki salmon with rice and broccoli.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3sSuROvOi3 data-wc=87>“Although I live like this to feel good and for my energy, there are vanity reasons too. &nbsp;We’re all getting older and I want to be in shape and look good too,” she adds. “I don’t really like fried food and I haven’t got a massive sweet tooth, but I’m part Italian and I do love a glass of wine at the weekend. And if I fancy some chocolate or a burger or curry, then I have it. A little bit of everything in moderation is fine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f4726b5114f-lydia-bright-hugging.jpg><p id=e-1-7pXmHu data-wc=18>by Lydia Bright and illustrated by Jojo Clinch (Puffin Books) is out 1 February 2024</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
