Besides <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hats</a>, scarves, and boots, one of the most needed accessories is arguably good gloves. Keeping hands warm can be one of the hardest things during the winter, but for those who are looking for options with both style and substance, the best choice is leather gloves. Not only do the best leather gloves protect and preserve, but they also look good while doing it, experts say.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Leather gloves are a winter wardrobe staple for several reasons,” fashion and bridal consultant Shane Clark says. “Not only do they keep your hands warm, but the natural insulating properties of leather help to retain body heat. They're a stylish and timeless accessory that also adds a touch of chic to your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cold-weather outfits</a>, making them both practical and fashionable.” Not only do the best leather gloves protect and preserve, but they also look good while doing it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are certainly plenty of options out there though, so choosing one pair can be difficult. If you're wondering whether cashmere-lined or a wool lining is the way to go, which type of leather is best to look for, or simply want to find something outside the norm, we tapped three fashion experts to give us their valued opinions and picks, helping to differentiate which leather gloves truly are the best and worthy of the investment in your cold weather wardrobe.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-lands-end-womens-lined-tech-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lands’ End Women’s Lined Tech Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lands&amp;acirc; End Women&amp;acirc;s Lined Tech Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QexJhygRdczPLkvfRKKEic_qXsw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lands-end-womens-lined-tech-gloves-be075a16c386498bb47c8e9db0e2a89a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's touchscreen-friendly thanks to thumb and forefinger pads.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some reviewers note these run small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This option from Lands’ End checks all the boxes on our quality control list, including fine materials and a price that won’t make you shudder. Coming in well under $100 and made from real leather and a soft, warm cashmere lining, this pair has an elevated look that a knit glove just won’t offer. The cherry on top is the tech-friendly thumb and forefinger pads which make scrolling a breeze while keeping your hands protected from the elements. Choose from six colorways — from plain black and brown to blackberry purple and bold red.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>6<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Leather exterior, cashmere lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-kebesu-winter-womens-fashion-leather-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kebesu Winter Women’s Fashion Leather Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kebesu Winter Women&amp;acirc;s Fashion Leather Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/J4L4goBil4KRoGjNtPdLVMR6_KM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kebesu-winter-womens-fashion-leather-gloves-1cbc3d03d33f4c538f384e43c5e1e82f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The full-hand touchscreen technology.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The soft, delicate leather might be more sensitive to scratching by sharp objects.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Quality leather gloves at a budget price point can often be hard to find, but this pair received rave reviews. The outer layer is made from sheepskin, which is malleable and soft, but also strongly resistant to cracking and abrasion. Inside you will find a layer of knitted wool, which helps protect from strong, cold winds, without any excess bulk. This ergonomic glove shape was designed with fit in mind, generally fitting true to size. Let’s not forget the full-hand touchscreen technology as well, that works on everything from smartphones to iPads. The ruched wrist allows for extra insulation and a better fit on the places of the hand that matter most.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–XXL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Leather exterior, wool lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fur-trimmed-ugg-genuine-shearling-leather-tech-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fur-Trimmed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UGG Genuine Shearling Leather Tech Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UGG Genuine Shearling Leather Tech Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1oX1UdPdM-IQJa2_ULJkTXNA2kM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-genuine-shearling-leather-tech-gloves-56b7dcd279414ec393e9892abb3145c4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The tech-friendly technology and cozy detailing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Reviewers encourage sizing up by at least one or two sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Never miss a text or call again in these leather touchscreen gloves that offer the warmth of shearling on the cuffs,” fashion editor Belle Bakst tells InStyle. “A must-have for any girl on the go, a touchscreen-compatible glove keeps you sane in the cooler months. Having to remove a glove just to answer a call is a huge nuisance!” The smooth leather glove is lined with a wool, cashmere, and nylon blend for incredible warmth, while Ugg’s signature, genuine shearling trim tops things off, adding an extra element of coziness to this pair. These pair great with a coat with a slim, long sleeve.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–L<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Leather exterior; genuine shearling trim; and wool/nylon/cashmere lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wool-lined-coach-sculpted-signature-leather-tech-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wool-Lined</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coach Sculpted Signature Leather Tech Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Coach Sculpted Signature Leather Tech Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BQoW-OKUpzwYpBs9qb-Cyg_keVQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/coach-sculpted-signature-leather-tech-gloves-6f85de5df76049ccac363252f5f296eb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Coach</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's made from a high-quality leather from a renowned leather goods brand.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The wrist slit might cause cold air to get in around the area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Known for craftsmanship, Coach’s gloves are made from the infamous leather the heritage brand is famous for. Slip into the buttery leather exterior, with a merino wool lining, chosen for warmth, durability, and water resistance. The signature hardware “C” gives a designer touch to the simple construction, while tech-friendly fingertips allow you to use any standard touchscreen while wearing. “This classic-style glove comes in three colors,” says content director Brooke Danielson. “They are the perfect glove for fall and the winter transition.” Choose from wine, black, and saddle colorways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6.5–8 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>3<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Leather exterior, merino wool lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-zippered-carolina-amato-l169-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Zippered</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Carolina Amato L169 Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Carolina Amato L169 Gloves " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/f5le_z3hGbCaj_6ke_qe4_kKvEM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/carolina-amato-l169-gloves--a732a60cf5c540d4a33e40e2679c0baa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They're easy to put on and take off thanks to the zipper detail.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They're only available in one colorway.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Carolina Amato has been producing quality gloves since 1979. This leather pair from the collection is sure to add a little extra oomph to any winter outfit. “The L169 gloves are as functional as they are fashionable, offering a perfect balance between style and warmth,” says fashion and bridal consultant Shane Clark. “These lambskin and shearling gloves are sure to elevate your cold-weather style.” We like that these also were designed with a zipper, to make getting into and taking off so much easier. The genuine shearling trim gives it a stylish yet practical embellishment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–L<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Lambskin leather exterior; shearling trim; and wool/cashmere lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-embellished-bruno-magli-chain-leather-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Embellished</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bruno Magli Chain Leather Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bruno Magli Chain Leather Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2pnm09hEyKuQRx5Z2HJ-_LljykQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bruno-magli-chain-leather-gloves-7a2cafed63bb4224af5887cec2c4e828.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This pair feels unique thanks to the metal detailing.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The care instructions advise professional dry cleaning only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gloves are an easy way to incorporate the biker chic trend into your everyday look. “Go heavy metal with chain detailing and grommets on the cuff that give a mini motorcycle vibe,” Bakst says. These hardware details are subtle though, allowing these gloves to not feel too punk. “Plus, you can match the hardware you pair with your outfit!” she adds. Whether a silver-toned hoop is your jewelry choice du jour, or you want to match the clasp on your favorite bag, choose from the black and silver option or the hot pink with gold, giving an entirely different vibe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>7–8.5 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Leather exterior, cashmere lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-vince-cashmere-lined-medium-leather-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vince Cashmere-Lined Medium Leather Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vince Cashmere-Lined Medium Leather Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gZwS8nwQxGmyq9j3Ks-yiannjls=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vince-cashmere-lined-medium-leather-gloves-8e533fc562a34505acd71051ec887d18.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The longer length protects more skin from the elements.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It's for dry clean or professional leather cleaning only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“These full-length Vince gloves will keep your arms and hands cozy,” Bakst says. “They're cashmere-lined, making them soft and super luxe.” She points out that since cashmere is a natural fiber, they’re the best option for everyday luxury. Danielson also recommends this longer-length pair. “A luxe twist on a standard leather glove,” she says. “I like the length for a cold, winter's day.” Made from premium leather, they’re a simple indulgence that looks and feels truly special. Pair with your favorite wool coat for a chic approach to cold-weather dressing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Leather exterior, cashmere lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tech-friendly-jcrew-italian-leather-tech-touch-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tech-Friendly</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Italian Leather Tech-Touch Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew Italian Leather Tech-Touch Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8s4DBD9Jo9Idl6iKYarZiEDzsjE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jcrew-italian-leather-tech-touch-gloves-3d45838692dc460690febfdd83cb5d1f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.Crew</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A warm, cashmere lining will keep hands toasty.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It may be harder to find a perfect fit with only three generic sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Tech lovers, this is the glove for you!” says Danielson. “A classic style with a modern twist. You won't have to sacrifice your TikTok scrolling when wearing these.” J.Crew’s leather is sourced from Italy, so you know its quality. They’re minimalist in design, without extra frills or unnecessary trims, but classic also means they can be worn with everything and will never go out of style. We love the chic stitching on the top and what’s more, there are several shades to choose from. Don’t be afraid to stock up with a few pairs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–L<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Leather exterior, cashmere lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-classic-portolano-cashmere-lined-nappa-leather-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Classic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Portolano Cashmere-Lined Nappa Leather Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Portolano Cashmere-Lined Nappa Leather Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mHvibf-WhPAWky_Punn7wbsNod0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/portolano-cashmere-lined-nappa-leather-gloves-c3748f76031647f191c489d17e074a36.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The sleek and simple design.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some reviewers note they run a little small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These Portolano gloves are sure to be a timeless addition to your accessory collection, according to Clark. “The sleek silhouette of the gloves ensures a tailored fit, while the nappa leather will effortlessly complement any look.” Simplicity at its finest, it’s all about the fine details that make these gloves stand out. The Portolano company was founded in Naples, Italy in 1895 as a glove producer, working with sumptuous, nappa leather from the region — a material that will wear well over time. The cashmere lining will not only keep hands warm but also won’t irritate sensitive skin due to the softness of the yarn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6–8.5 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>9<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Nappa leather exterior, cashmere lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-mulberry-darley-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mulberry Darley Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mulberry Darley Gloves " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QyQRDCd1dsxvGg_sTNxw9Arc2XA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mulberry-darley-gloves-8d3a39e79cd843da92ea046b5550ea54.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mulberry</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The gloves are finished with a protective coating to increase durability.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The postman's lock closure may add bulk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The Darley gloves seamlessly blend sophistication and warmth,” says Clark. “Made of supple, soft leather and a timeless lock closure, which not only adds a touch of heritage charm but also ensures a secure fit, allowing you to brave the cold with confidence and style.” Mulberry has been working with leather since the early 1970s — modern fans probably know the brand for its infamous Alexa satchel shape, inspired by Alexa Chung and introduced in 2010.

These faux fur cuffs were made to be seen. “Not only do these keep you comfy, they also pair gorgeously with any other faux fur items and coats without detailed cuffs,” she adds. Choose from three colorways to suit your preference.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>S–L<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Material: </strong>Leather/faux fur (polyester) exterior, cashmere lining</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-colored-portolano-slit-bow-nappa-leather-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Colored</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Portolano Slit Bow Nappa Leather Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Portolano Slit Bow Nappa Leather Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/t7p8q_p7ApG2x_FSzgscQqWo8JE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/portolano-slit-bow-nappa-leather-gloves-dafefc0ae7f044328886b7383deea74a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The delicate, bow detail lends a sophisticated touch.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The style only comes in one colorway.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Add <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a bold pop of color</a> and polish with these all-over, garnet red, nappa leather gloves,” Bakst recommends. “The bow detail adds a playful, sweet touch.” When you’re looking for something that gives a little extra to any look, red is a shoo-in. “A colorful glove will add interest to an all-over neutral look without feeling like too much,” she adds. These are made from soft and durable nappa leather and won’t break the bank, either.

It’s only fitting that one of our fashion experts recommended something from this fourth-generation, heritage glove brand. “These ribbed cashmere gloves are a sophisticated staple to your winter wardrobe,” says Clark. “The rich, espresso hue is so versatile, while the ribbed sleeves are perfect to keep the cold out.” Slip into these for something that is seriously warm, cozy, and chic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6.5–8.5 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Leather, cashmere</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fashion-paula-rowan-caroline-leather-gloves></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fashion</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paula Rowan Caroline Leather Gloves</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Paula Rowan Caroline Leather Gloves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2yjKG1qkqfQxzflrPq-xP3musds=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/paula-rowan-caroline-leather-gloves-e62a9746e9e647248685321e339eca6d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Moda Operandi</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The single, monochromatic fastener ensures a tighter fit at the wrist.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The silk lining is not as warm as wool or cashmere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Paula Rowan's handmade-in-Italy gloves are ‘couture for the hands’,” Clark says. The brand is designed in Dublin, Ireland, but made in Naples, Italy, a region known for leather making and craft, by hand. Paula Rowan has been worn by celebrities such as Lady Gaga and Julianne Moore, but these gloves are a small luxury that everyone can invest in. “Designed with meticulous attention to detail, the angular cut at the wrist is carefully stitched to accent your wrists perfectly,” Clark notes, regarding this particular pair.

Made partially with sustainable fibers, this quilted, leather mitten has a warm, fleece lining and ribbed knit wrists, to slide on and off with ease.

The finish is oh-so-stylish, but caring for it can be a bit more difficult. That’s why our pick for the best suede glove combines the sleekness of the material with a two-toned palm made from the matte, topside of the skin. On top, you get the beautiful, textural finish of suede while on the bottom, the smooth leather will be a little more durable and easier to care for and clean. Each pair is made in Naples, Italy, and is finished with a cashmere lining for luxurious warmth and a rich feel. The rich burgundy shade will accompany most outfits beautifully, from neutral black, camel, or gray outerwear, to complimentary gem tones.

The style at its root is more about function, rather than fashion, but the perforated material and traditional design are very much en mode too. Whether you are looking for a pair to help enhance your grip on the steering wheel during a long commute, or are simply looking to lean into the moto trend, this classic option has vent and knuckle holes and a snap closure on the back. This pair will be best worn in the fall months when temperatures haven’t reached sub-zero, should you like to wear them outside the car.

Your gloves should fit snugly but not pinch or too constricting in any one place.” She recommends testing potential matches by trying to make a fist comfortably. “If you can't, they are too tight!” she explains. Danielson also stresses the importance of a good fit and recommends the trial and error method. “Make sure you try on multiple sizes and get the fit right,” she says. She also encourages getting assistance if you are shopping in person. “Have whoever is helping you understand your typical glove size as well,” Danielson adds.</li><li><strong>Type of Leather: </strong>“Different types of leather offer varying levels of durability,” says Clark. “Generally, full-grain leather is considered the highest quality and most durable option for gloves. It comes from the top layer of the hide and retains the natural grain, making it resistant to wear and tear.” She adds that top-grain leather is also a good choice since it is sanded and refined for a smoother appearance while maintaining decent durability. “Opt for high-quality materials to ensure longevity and a polished look,” she says.</li></ul><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Details: </strong>“Keep in mind the features you might want in your gloves,” says Bakst. “While some gloves offer touchscreen ability, many don't!

First, you’ll need a small measuring tape. Experts encourage measuring your dominant hand (the one you use to write with). Measure around the widest part of your hand, not including the thumb. Then measure from the top of the middle finger to the bottom of the palm. Whichever is the larger measurement from the two, is your glove size. For brands that are not measured in inches and rather offered in XS–L sizing, be sure to compare the size range in the details for a close to accurate fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To determine your glove size, measure the circumference of your hand around your knuckles, excluding your thumb.

She recommends applying a small amount of leather conditioner to also help soften the material. “Be patient, as leather tends to become more supple and comfortable with each wear over time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bakst suggests softening the material with a household appliance. “If your leather gloves are too snug, try hitting them with a blow dryer on warm or high heat, this will allow the material to soften,” she says. “Place your hand in the gloves once they are cool to touch and stretch them gently.” She recommends repeating this process a few times over to get the perfect fit. “If they are really stiff you can oil them up with an approved lube and wear them, clenching your fist in a repeat release and clinching motion,” Danielson adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best way to clean leather gloves?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“To clean your leather gloves, start by removing any surface dirt with a soft brush or cloth,” says Clark. “For more stubborn stains, you can use a mild soap or leather cleaner applied with a damp cloth.” She recommends testing a small area on the inside of your wrist first to ensure the cleaner doesn't discolor the leather. After cleaning, allow the gloves to air-dry and avoid placing them on radiators or in direct sunlight. Bakst also recommends testing a small area before using any leather cleaners or cream cleansers on the whole glove. “If tears or other little details need attention, a cobbler or tailor can repair them,” she says. Danielson also suggests consulting the cobblers at your favorite shoe repair, since they are experts in leather, after all.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Full-time freelance writer, and fashion editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kristina Rutkowski</a> has been covering all things style, trend, and shopping for over 10 years.
