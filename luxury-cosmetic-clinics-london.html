But as the demand for facial rejuvenation has skyrocketed, such stigma has faded and a more luxurious experience is desired.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While Harley Street has long been considered the foremost destination for such injectable tweakments, patients often find themselves huddled in worn multi-clinic waiting-rooms and climbing endless flights of stairs before they reach a drab treatment room. Not so chic. But now, an elite group of superclinics is revolutionising the way in which <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/cosmetic-procedures/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="aesthetic treatments" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">aesthetic treatments</a> are approached. These grand destinations are eschewing starkly medical settings for lavish interiors and light-flooded treatment suites, where a host of experts are gathered under the same roof.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One such superclinic, Ouronyx, is likely London’s most talked-about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/cosmetic-procedures/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=aesthetics class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">aesthetics</a> destination. With its sweeping marble staircase, curated art collection and expertly sourced minimalist Italian furniture, it’s akin to walking into a luxury boutique hotel. "We wanted to challenge the old concepts," says the co-founder Ida Banek, an entrepreneur and professor of psychology. "If you’re not sick, why do you need to be in a clinical, medical setting?"</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for #SkinSchool: Trialling a Sarah Chapman facial" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2020-01-16-at-12-27-22-1579177668.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Within these beautiful surroundings, a stone’s throw from Buckingham Palace, the most important aspect remains the treatment plan and the results. "The quality of care starts from the second you walk through the door," says Banek. "You should feel cared for and enjoy it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the past, you’d often be required to visit a series of specialists – perhaps one for anti-ageing injectables, another for pigmentation-fading laser, and so on. But these superclinics are one-stop shops, making accessing the right specialists easier and scheduling all those various appointments more convenient. By grouping numerous experts together, they are able to offer a 360-degree approach to aesthetics, working to rebalance and refresh with personalised plans and an unusually extensive menu of options.</p><img alt=superclinics title=Superclinics width=5236 height=7062 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hb-superclinic-2-1644934795.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Adam Goodison</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr Marco Nicoloso, Ouronyx’s medical director and resident doctor (one of six based there, specialising in everything from radiofrequency to hair loss), explains this approach: "If you go to a car mechanic and demand that they only fix the brake fluid, you could still leave with a broken car. You’re not the expert. Often, we find underlying issues could be caused by less obvious problems such as hormones, or something as simple as the wrong skincare regime."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another opening that has adopted a similar outlook is the Clinic at Holland Park, which is in the heart of the tree-lined, well-heeled west-London neighbourhood. It is the brainchild of surgeon Richard Scawn, the head of reconstructive and aesthetic eye surgery at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital, and his wife Debbie Wosskow, the serial entrepreneur and co-founder of the women-only members’ club, AllBright.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Scawn found he was increasingly asked to "coordinate" his patients’ pre- and post-surgery protocols. "The role of a surgeon can be siloed: once you’ve done your job you don’t often see your patients again," he says. "But they were frequently relying on me to help them source further expertise – injectables, skincare recommendations or ongoing wellness advice – which are all important when it comes to maintaining surgical results. They were going from place-to-place in search of this and I knew there must be a more holistic solution."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the couple found the perfect building ("high ceilings, spacious treatment rooms, masses of natural light") they decided to combine their expertise to create a welcoming, curated, club-like venture. "Plastic surgeon, dermatologist, private GP, facialist and even eyelash technician – we’re combining them all in this beautiful space," says Scawn. Of the Clinic, he says: "It’s less stark, less clinical, yes. But 'beneath the bonnet' is everything you need: state-of-the-art operating rooms, lasers, cryotherapy and relaxing recovery pods. It’s the whole gamut under one beautifully designed roof."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nestled within the capital’s most elegant postcodes, the locations of these aesthetic hubs are as carefully considered as what lies within them. "Harley Street has its place, of course, especially for surgery and expertise, but it can be a bit tired," says Scawn. "Lots of my patients were looking for an elevated experience."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And that elevated experience is what sets these superclinics apart. Sleek and specialised, these are the new addresses to note...</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>OURONYX</strong></h2><img alt=superclinics title=Superclinics width=8688 height=5792 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/modus-ouronyx-5-copy-1644934929.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ouronyx prides itself on blending aesthetic enhancement with psychological wellbeing. Dr Nicoloso’s approach is to treat clients ethically – encouraging authentic self-expression, free from the seductive but often harmful cycle of aesthetic addiction, and sustainably – challenging the quick fixes and promoting preventative care with natural enhancement and self-optimisation techniques. Committed to regenerative treatments (they're leaders in treatments like HarmonyCA, <a data-stringify-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a44771531/polynucleotides/ data-sk=tooltip_parent href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a44771531/polynucleotides/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=polynucleotides class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">polynucleotides</a> and NeoGen Plasma), this is not the place for a dramatic makeover, rather "mindful aesthetics" – as Banek puts it.</p><span data-node-id=20>The company’s other founder is Marc Princen, the former executive vice-president at Allergan, the pharmaceutical giant that produces the brand Botox – so it’s perhaps no surprise that the injections here are apparently the most pain-free in town. But it’s not just the results that are first-class at Ouronyx, but the facilities are too, from the 3-D scans that can detect how much Botox or filler might be residing in your face (a way of avoiding over-injecting and that tell-tale surprised or puffy look), to the VIP exit if you are worried about lurking paparazzi. After applying post-procedure skincare, make-up artists are on hand to redo your make-up so that you leave with confidence. </span><img alt=superclincis title="Taktouk Clinic Wassim Taktouk" width=4032 height=3024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taktouk-1645012204.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Situated up a secret staircase and behind an Hermès-orange door, is the fabulous clinic of Dr Wassim Taktouk. Featuring soft furnishings that were originally from his private home, the space resembles a boutique-hotel suite, filled with olive-green velvet and marble, and designed by the doctor himself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Decor aside, the most important thing for Dr. Taktouk is the comfort of his clients. "Aesthetics are generally a private thing," he says, "yet Harley Street is very public. Here you will never be spotted going into a ‘clinic’: to passers-by are simply walking into someone’s apartment." It’s the "antithesis of a hospital", but it’s well equipped to offer everything you could need: a professor of dermatology (‘The Godfather of Skin’, as Taktouk likes to call him) performing skin treatments such as PRP (platelet-rich plasma, which utilises your own blood platelets to promote collagen production), a GP and, of course, Dr Taktouk himself, who administers injectables such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/skincare/a29759932/profhilo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin boosters" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">skin boosters</a>, one of his favourite types of aesthetics for a long-term glow boost.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">GALEN</h2><img alt="a living room with a chandelier and couches" title="Galen Clinic" width=6720 height=4480 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/20-10-23-galen-clinic-shot-2-010-662a7bdf6220e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Galen</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A grand, five-floor Georgian building in W1’s Queen Anne Street, Galen is geographically close to Harley Street – but miles ahead in terms of exclusivity and indulgence. Using comprehensive diagnostic approaches to inform individualised treatment plans integrating various therapeutic modalities, it aims to treat clients holistically. Indeed, Galen describes itself as a multi-disciplinary ‘wellness centre’ offering all kinds of medical services, including – yes – cosmetic procedures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Co-founder Dr. Andreas Androulakakis, a consultant plastic surgeon, leads a team of specialist doctors with expertise in longevity. “Our vision for Galen was very clear; we wanted to redefine beauty and aesthetic intervention as a combination of science-engineered healthcare, physical transformation, and emotional wellbeing, by harnessing the power of an unrivalled assembly of experts and specialists.” It’s all about medical excellence alongside luxury and comfort, he says, “with natural results being paramount to the patient experience”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://thegalenclinic.com/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Visit Galen, 9 Queen Anne Street, W1G 9HW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">Visit Galen, 9 Queen Anne Street, W1G 9HW</a></p><strong data-node-id=34><h2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>HARRODS WELLNESS CLINIC</strong></h2></strong><img alt=superclinics title="Harrods Wellness Clinic" width=4912 height=6140 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/harrods-1644935403.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Harrods is associated with the best of the best, and so what we offer here has to be the same," says Dr Marwa Ali, the department store’s in-house aesthetic doctor.

"I ask them: if I had a magic wand to grant your three wishes, what would they be?" she explains. "It gives clients the freedom to open up, and allows me to gauge what they really need. They have the control, but I can guide them in the right direction." It's not all about injectables; one of her favourite gadgets is the Stellar M22, a laser and IPL (intense pulsed light) machine that can be programmed to treat more than 30 skin conditions, from sun spots to hair removal.</p><h2 data-node-id=41 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>MONTROSE LONDON</strong></h2><img alt="montrose london" title="montrose london" width=5849 height=3942 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/montrose-london-662a7b83ead51.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">James McDonald</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><br>With the bespoke approach to aesthetics you’d expect from a setting so luxurious looking, Montrose London – a sublimely decked period townhouse in the heart of Belgravia – offers an array of dermatology and aesthetic treatments, from mole mapping to advanced facials, injectables and body contouring. Prioritising discretion from the off set, you’ll find it behind a private gated entrance and once it inside feels more like a chic boutique hotel than a clinic of any kind.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Founded by three NHS plastic surgeons, Dr. Georgina Williams, Dr. Shaimaa Jamshidi and Dr. Jonathan Dunne work closely with a team of dermatologists and plastic surgeons to ensure that all needs are met by leading experts in their respective fields.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://montroseclinics.com/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Visit Montrose London, 9 West Eaton Place, SW1X 8LT " rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">Visit Montrose London, 9 West Eaton Place, SW1X 8LT</a></p><h2 data-node-id=46 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong></strong><strong>23MD</strong></h2><img alt=superclinics title="23MD Suha Kersh" width=890 height=594 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/23md-1645012032.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This discreet Chelsea clinic may be under the radar, but what it lacks in shouty claims, it makes up for in elegance.

"It refreshes and balances without that 'blown-up appearance'," she says. "The face is given back its grace without changing its fundamental character."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her co-founder and husband, Dr. Galy, is one of the UK’s most in-demand specialists in bioidentical-hormone replacement therapy (BHRT).

So good are her results, there’s a six-month waiting list for new patients.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sarahchapman.com/skinesis-medical data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Visit Dr Alexis at Skinesis, 259 Pavilion Road, SW1X" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-product-id=c991a62b-cebb-4cf2-bb7c-8fd298767719 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.sarahchapman.com/skinesis-medical data-product-url=https://www.sarahchapman.com/skinesis-medical data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sarahchapman.com%2Fskinesis-medical" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=sarahchapman.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=5f77cafa-1d27-46b4-b5ae-1f426e41345d data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=sarahchapman.com class="body-btn-link product-links-button css-1xbq6k6 e1aq0z090">Visit Dr Alexis at Skinesis, 259 Pavilion Road, SW1X</a></p><h2 data-node-id=71 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">CHELSEA DENTAL CLINIC</h2><img alt="chelsea dental clinic" title="Chelsea Dental Clinic" width=10937 height=8203 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cdc-fulham-road6875-662a7af713c90.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Chelsea Dental Clinic</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><br>Not an aesthetics clinic per se, but one dedicated specifically to smiles – and ‘super’ nonetheless – is Chelsea Dental Clinic, which has recently undergone its own makeover. With interiors combining contrasting textures (from an organic textured stone desk anchoring the reception, to textured clay walls nodding to a microscopic detail of bone – the core component of teeth) alongside calm muted colours, snug furnishing and inspiring artwork, it’s far removed from the stark dental clinics we’ve all come to know.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=74 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The brainchild of famed London dentist Dr. Rhona Eskander, who’s at the helm of the practice, Chelsea Dental Clinic offers expertise in cosmetic dentistry (think Invisalign, bonding, veneers and whitening) as well as subtle facial injectables such as anti-wrinkle injections and dermal fillers. With results as artistic as the execution of the refurb, it’s the place for excellently executed tweaks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=75 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.chelseadentalclinic.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Visit Chelsea Dental Clinic, 298 Fulham Road, SW10 9EP" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60">Visit Chelsea Dental Clinic, 298 Fulham Road, SW10 9EP</a></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6i4qrrCmqmeZ5FohnGDlHBvaWecqsW2vthmmqirnZrBqq%2BMnKOippmYwG64zqebqKZf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
