She’s someone that has schemed and worked to infiltrate our friend group. And the name that you all know her as, the woman whose birthday was celebrated, who we’ve been trying to champion and support and defend is Reality Von Tease.”</p><p>The drama created a divide between Monica and her five&nbsp;Real Housewives&nbsp;of Salt Lake City cast members, whom she hadn’t spoken to until the Season 4 reunion filmed months later. The reunion also touched on a certain parental relationship, which adds new context to <a href=#>Monica and her mom’s video from RHOSLC</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=monica-and-her-mom-s-video-from-rhoslc>Monica and her mom’s video from RHOSLC</h2><p>Leaked to social media—we don’t know for sure by who but considering it’s shot from Monica’s POV, we can only guess—Monica and her mom’s video from RHOSLC shows their explosive argument, <a href=# rel=nofollow>which you can watch here</a>.

How can you forget that your job is to get on airtime, to get us into as many scenes as possible? You gotta play nice. I know you don’t like her, I know you got beef with her, but you’re an actress. You gotta pretend like all is right in the world. It’s a job. It’s a show. It’s a reality show that you worked hard to get on.<br><strong>Monica: </strong>You left me completely in the f—g water with these bitches. You took Angie’s side. I was not a disaster, I was not an embarrassment.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>You were in someone’s home, yelling and dropping—<br><strong>Monica: </strong>So was everyone else, go yell at them. Go yell at Heather, go yell at Lisa.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>No one else was yelling<br><strong>Monica: </strong>Yes they were. You are so gross. You are so gross.<br><strong>Linda:</strong> You shouldn’t have run away.<br><strong>Monica: </strong>Run away? I was leaving. You were in my face being disgusting in front of all those people. I was being disgusting? Angie started that shit.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>You put a kibosh on.<br><strong>Monica: </strong>You don’t know what you’re doing.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>You abandoned me.<br><strong>Monica:</strong> I abandoned you?<br><strong>Linda: </strong>I had to drive home in a s—t box.<br><strong>Monica: </strong>You had to drive home in a s—t box? You should be grateful they paid for your ride. How about thank you for giving me a free ride home?<br><strong>Linda: </strong>How about thank you? I took the day off work for that.<br><strong>Monica: </strong>Mom, stop. The fact that you are the victim right now.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>I’m not saying I’m the victim.<br><strong>Monica: </strong>You’re acting like the victim.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>Take it down.<br><strong>Monica: </strong>You don’t want to be yelled at? Then leave. You are in my house.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>You have lost sight of the vision, you lost sight of the job. You got out of control.<br><strong>Monica: </strong>That’s why Lori my s—t was the best of everyone that night and everyone else dropped the fucking ball.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>You were the hottest mess, that makes you the best?<br><strong>Monica: </strong>You were disgusting. You looked like an awful mother, you didn’t even fucking care I fell down the stairs.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>No, I didn’t.<br><strong>Monica: </strong>Wow, okay, get out. Get out, dead ass. Get out of my house. Nana is waiting, she’s very upset.<br><strong>Linda: </strong>And your boobs hanging out were disgusting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>In the final, third part of the RHOSLC reunion, which aired on January 23, 2024, Monica told Andy Cohen <a rel=nofollow href=#>she hadn’t spoken to her mom</a> since filming wrapped. She also revealed what happened when she was supposed to meet her family in Bermuda, but they canceled last minute. “My mom messaged production, before we all left for Bermuda, and said, ‘I want to go,’ and production said no. So she was very, very pissed. She felt like, ‘I’m the one that should be there.’ … She threw a huge fit and I thought, ‘Did she do this because she didn’t get to come?’ “</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
