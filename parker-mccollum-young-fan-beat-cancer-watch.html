After a rigorous, nearly year-long course of treatment, the young boy reached maintenance for his cancer in October 2021, and as of the 2022-2023 New Year, he's officially cancer-free.</p><p>Will and his family celebrated the milestone with tickets to see McCollum in concert, and after the singer learned about his story during a meet and greet, he invited Will to get up onstage.</p><p>"Will is gonna ring the bell here in a few days — he has beat leukemia," McCollum explained to the crowd from the stage as the young boy stood by his side.</p><p>"And at the meet and greet, Will asked me if he could say something into the microphone. So if it's okay with Oklahoma City, we'd like to let Will say a little something something," the singer continued, as the audience vigorously cheered their approval.</p><p>Will then took the microphone and walked toward the front of the stage. "Hey OKC! Guess what? I'm kicking cancer's a--!" he proclaimed. The crowd erupted in cheers, and McCollum removed his hat in support of the special moment.</p><p>From there, McCollum launched into a rendition of his song "Hell of a Year" — a song that, given Will's ordeal, holds special meaning for him, and he posted video footage of himself singing along on his social media page.</p><p>"Over 1,300 chemo pills. Over 400 antibiotics. 5 more procedures. 2022 had it all," the caption alongside the post reads. "One ICONIC night to end a crazy year."</p><p>McCollum is taking a short break from touring before he resumes his live show calendar in February, and heads out on the road as an opening act for <a href=#>Morgan Wallen</a> later in the year. He's also gearing up to release a new album; ahead of the full project, he has dropped a few songs, including "Handle on You" and "Stoned."</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>These Country Stars Have Battled Cancer:</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmqZmioLKzecycmqiknKq6bsXOrqWgZZaWu26uxJqrZpuRo7CmvoywmK2bmGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
