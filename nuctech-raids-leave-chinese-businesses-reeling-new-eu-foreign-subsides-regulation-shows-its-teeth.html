Since January, the EU has wielded the weapon, which was adopted last year, four times. On each occasion, it has targeted Chinese companies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The FSR is designed to root out “market-distorting” handouts, by forcing non-European entities to be as transparent about what they receive from their governments as firms from the bloc, which are subject to stringent state aid disclosure rules.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/12/07/clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:08</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">China-EU summit: Xi Jinping calls on EU leaders to work together and strengthen mutual trust</p><p>China-EU summit: Xi Jinping calls on EU leaders to work together and strengthen mutual trust</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It can be triggered during procurement processes, as well as merger and acquisition activity. Or – as with Nuctech – the commission can decide to investigate any business operating in the EU that it suspects has received state subsidies and is disadvantaging local competitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the commission did not name Nuctech in its statement about “unannounced inspections”, it said that officials had “indications that the company may have received foreign subsidies that could distort the internal market”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nuctech – a partially state-owned offshoot of Tsinghua University that was previously run by Hu Haifeng, son of China’s former president Hu Jintao – has been frozen out of some Western markets over security concerns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company said it was “cooperating with the European Commission and is committed to defending its reputation as a fully independent and self-supporting economic operator”.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/09/26/thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:18</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese vice-premier urges Brussels to ‘exercise restraint’ in countering Beijing’s trade tactics</p><p>Chinese vice-premier urges Brussels to ‘exercise restraint’ in countering Beijing’s trade tactics</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Michel Struys, a Brussels-based partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, said every Chinese company in the EU should be prepared to receive a knock on the door, given the trigger-happy nature in which the EU is using the FSR.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Chinese companies have been put on the back foot, but the best form of defence is attack, and that is to be prepared. A lack of preparation is the real problem here,” said Struys, who has advised some of the companies already targeted under the new law.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even before Tuesday’s events, businesses were worried. Before Nuctech, regulators went after European subsidiaries of solar giants Longi and Shanghai Electric, as well as CRRC Corporation Limited, the state-owned rolling stock company.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The rapid-fire nature of the tool flies in the face of conventional wisdom that Brussels is a slow and lumbering bureaucracy. Trade investigations typically take years to conclude, and one open case listed on the World Trade Organization’s website has been at the consultation stage since April 1995.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/04/17/clip-thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:06</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">President Xi Jinping tells German chancellor to seek ‘common ground’ to strengthen ties</p><p>President Xi Jinping tells German chancellor to seek ‘common ground’ to strengthen ties</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the FSR comes from the world of competition, where things move much more quickly. In the case of procurement or takeover cases investigated under the law, investigators have just 110 days to complete their work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They also demand levels of openness that many Chinese businesses are not ready for. EU authorities can command Chinese firms operating in the bloc to hand over their books for forensic scrutiny, with little time to get them in order.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The local subsidiary of rail company CRRC withdrew from a bidding process in Bulgaria after balking at the requirements of complying with a procurement investigation. EU industry boss Thierry Breton responded on X, formerly Twitter, that the inquiry had “already yielded results”, suggesting this was what he had intended to happen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Struys, “the reaction time is slow” for Chinese companies. “They need to talk to x, y and z, sometimes even the party. Many of them are not ready for this,” he said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/03/08/Thu_web-copy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">12:53</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">‘Overtaking on a bend’: how China’s EV industry charged ahead to dominate the global market</p><p>‘Overtaking on a bend’: how China’s EV industry charged ahead to dominate the global market</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In an interview with the Post, Fang Dongkui, secretary general of the China Chamber of Commerce to the EU, laid out a litany of grievances with the tool.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The commission’s definition of “foreign financial contributions” was “overly broad and non-exhaustive”, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Fang, Brussels is “scrutinising subsidies received by Chinese parent companies that were passed through on to their European entities”, which the chamber thinks should be treated as separate entities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perhaps most concerning for Chinese businesses is the danger that adhering to this law could set them up to contravene other laws in China.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/10/13/CLEAN-THUMB_2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:37</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">EU foreign policy chief urges Beijing ‘to find common ground’ to tackle trade imbalance with Europe</p><p>EU foreign policy chief urges Beijing ‘to find common ground’ to tackle trade imbalance with Europe</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">European businesses have complained of the challenges of complying with Beijing’s anti-espionage and data transfer regulations, while continuing to satisfy incoming rules on supply chain audits set in Brussels.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now it appears that the same anxiety could be spreading to Chinese firms too.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Feng said that “in specific instances, the commission had requested confidential bidding information, including pricing details, contracts or documents containing business secrets that allegedly could be related to subsidies”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These actions are “posing a risk [to Chinese companies] of breaching relevant tender regulations or Chinese laws”, he said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2024/03/28/thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:23</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Dutch prime minister raises cyberspying allegations in talks with Chinese leader Xi</p><p>Dutch prime minister raises cyberspying allegations in talks with Chinese leader Xi</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The instrument has added new wrinkles to an already strained EU-China trading relationship. Brussels has 34 open trade investigations against Beijing, while two-thirds of its active trade defence measures – currently numbering 184 – are against China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For François Chimits, an analyst of Chinese trade and economic activity at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Brussels, this could be the EU tool with the most teeth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So sweeping are its requirements, it could act as a “de facto ban” for many firms, who would simply not be able or prepared to comply. “The commission has an awful lot of leeway to expel almost any Chinese firm,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most of them receive subsidies, so this could lead to a de facto ban from the single market on some Chinese companies in certain sectors. It is a more elegant way of doing so than an outright ban Instead it creates a very significant barrier to entry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyltc%2BlpqaZk658or7TopqlnV9of3d8kXJsaKalmMGmr8dmqZqhlKh6rbHAr5xmm5ieu6a%2FxGaZrquZo7K0v8SsZKudlaG2r7OMp5ywZZWqeqe70Z6goKZdqMKjv8idnKxlopq0trjAraCopl2otbDD0magratdqbKmwMc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
