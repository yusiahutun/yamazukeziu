Between a handful of styling gigs, visits with friends and family, and various romantic getaways, it felt like my bright pink luggage had become my go-to bag — and honestly, I was over it.</p><p>My old <a href=# id=auto-tag_suitcase data-tag=suitcase>suitcase</a> was something I’d had for years, and it was bulky and heavy even without anything in it. So, when <a href=# id=auto-tag_tiktok data-tag=tiktok>TikTok</a> began serving me videos of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">viral rolling garment bag</a>, I was curious. It looked small enough to work as a carry-on, yet large enough to hold multiple outfits and pairs of shoes. It had wheels, but also multiple straps to sling over your shoulder.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>So, I caved and ordered the <a data-pmc-sp-product=16c4a961f05df21851255434780352c4 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"seyfocnia Rolling Garment Bag","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Rolling Garment Bags,Garment Bag with Wheels Travel Garment Bag with Shoe Compartment Rolling Duffle Bag with Wheels Trolley Suit Bag Overnight Weekender Bags for Women or Men-Grey","price":"72.99","id":"B0C6QCFHY7","category":"Garment Bags"},"id":1738084,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>seyfocnia Rolling Garment Bag</a> on Amazon for $70, hoping it would become my new travel companion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/seyfocnia-Rolling-Garment-Bag.jpg><p>Within a few weeks, I had the opportunity to put my rolling garment bag to the test. I was traveling to South Carolina to visit family for the weekend, and needed to bring enough clothes for daytime activities, nice dinners, workouts, and traveling back home. This 22”L x 12.5”W x 12.2”H suitcase is said to have enough room for three-ish days of clothing, so it was the perfect pick for my trip.</p><p>Typically, I’m a messy overpacker — I squish and shove everything until it fits, then worry about wrinkles once I arrive. But <a data-pmc-sp-product=06eb46568794aae394cd522dd592ce4b href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"this suitcase","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Rolling Garment Bags,Garment Bag with Wheels Travel Garment Bag with Shoe Compartment Rolling Duffle Bag with Wheels Trolley Suit Bag Overnight Weekender Bags for Women or Men-Grey","price":"72.99","id":"B0C6QCFHY7","category":"Garment Bags"},"id":1738084,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>this suitcase</a> doesn’t allow for that. You must lay all your clothes flat inside the garment bag part, otherwise it’s harder to zip up the sides to form a duffle bag. That detail forced me to stay organized and really plan out my outfits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rolling-garment-bag-inside-rotated.jpeg><p>There is also one huge side compartment that’s meant to be used for shoes, and for me, it was able to hold at least three pairs (including boots). That’s because once the duffle is zipped into place, the clothes inside the garment bag actually wrap around the shoe pocket, and you might even be left with extra room inside your bag.</p><p>It’s important to note that the less you put inside the garment bag, the more you’ll be able to fit in the actual suitcase area. So, if you’re heading somewhere special, you might want to use the garment section to protect just one or two pieces, such as a suit or a sequined dress you’re rocking for a destination wedding, before packing your bag like you normally would.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rolling-Garment-Bag-Parts.jpg><p>One thing I didn’t love about the rolling garment bag is the cart rod, which slides into a sleeve in the back and makes the suitcase rollable. Because my duffle was fully packed, the balance was off, and my suitcase kept tipping to one side instead of rolling easily.</p><p>I also wasn’t quite sure where to put the crossbody strap when I wasn’t slinging my bag over my shoulder (it was dragging on the ground a bit), but it does unhook easily, so maybe that’s a me problem.</p><p>While <a data-pmc-sp-product=283257c59eca7351fd1b05ccda97cdf7 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"thi","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Rolling Garment Bags,Garment Bag with Wheels Travel Garment Bag with Shoe Compartment Rolling Duffle Bag with Wheels Trolley Suit Bag Overnight Weekender Bags for Women or Men-Grey","price":"72.99","id":"B0C6QCFHY7","category":"Garment Bags"},"id":1738084,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>thi</a> <a data-pmc-sp-product=b09fb14bcec574ccdc92488ed59d493f href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"s","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Rolling Garment Bags,Garment Bag with Wheels Travel Garment Bag with Shoe Compartment Rolling Duffle Bag with Wheels Trolley Suit Bag Overnight Weekender Bags for Women or Men-Grey","price":"72.99","id":"B0C6QCFHY7","category":"Garment Bags"},"id":1738084,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>s</a> <a data-pmc-sp-product=e7efff751b8c1b95a1ca072bec52a714 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"duffle","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Rolling Garment Bags,Garment Bag with Wheels Travel Garment Bag with Shoe Compartment Rolling Duffle Bag with Wheels Trolley Suit Bag Overnight Weekender Bags for Women or Men-Grey","price":"72.99","id":"B0C6QCFHY7","category":"Garment Bags"},"id":1738084,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>duffle</a> was definitely light enough to tote around the airport and small enough to fit into the overhead compartment on the plane, I did end up checking my bag on the way back. It arrived back in New York safe and in-tact, which is always impressive for an under-$100, material suitcase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9OrmK%2BdnGR%2BeH%2BXaW9tZ6Kkua21zaBkoJmiorKvwIybmKBlo6q2ta%2FArJxmqpWrtqbDjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
