However, there appear to be hundreds of variations which can not only differ on the part of Britain you are holding the cue, but also the boozer you are playing inside.</p><p>However, just like many things, pool may not be quite as simple as everybody believes.</p><p>Ladbrokes' PR man Alex Apati, who is still scorned from two defeats on the pub felt earlier this week, tweeted a poll asking which rules people play. In total, 75% of the thousands of punters who replied said that you are only allowed one shot.</p><p><b>Read More:</b><a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=news> Fans 'can't stop watching' Ricky Evans' face after hitting three-second 180</a></p><p>One pool lover replied: “Only ever one (shot) on the black”.</p><p>However, this was sternly contested by another pub pool player who stated: "I disagree - with one shot you’re gaining absolutely no advantage if you’re on the black. A player who isn’t on the black can use that to their advantage to get two shots themselves.” Meanwhile, this opinion was aggressively contested by a fan who wrote "two shots on the black ball is for prats.”</p><p><i><b>What are your views on this evidently touchy subject?

However, another made a diplomatic approach by insisting the rule varies depending on the geographical settings the game is taking place within. "Depends which pub you're in. And which part of town," the fan tweeted.</p><p>This debate left us curious and much to the shock of the majority, the official rules of blackball pool - the most common in pubs where you play with yellow and red balls, state that the person on the black ball is allowed two shots when their opponent makes a foul shot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article28811862.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Boris-Johnson-to-appear-on-Eastenders.jpg><p>"It doesn’t matter which variant of the rules you are playing, the rules will remain the same,” the official rules state, as quoted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>guysplaypool.com.</a></p><p>“If the opposing player commits a foul and you are on the black ball, you are allowed two shots on it."</p><p>And there you have it. If you are on the black ball and your opponent makes a foul, you are allowed two shots.
