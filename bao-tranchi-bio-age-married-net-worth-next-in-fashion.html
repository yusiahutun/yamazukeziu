And for this, Bao feels like she can never thank them enough.</span></p><p><span>‚ÄúThey came to America with nothing, not speaking a word of English, and worked jobs that most Americans wouldn‚Äôt. They worked endlessly until retirement just for the promise of their children‚Äôs happiness. I am beyond indebted and forever Thankful for the Love and support and sacrifice of my Parents,‚Äù she explained.</span></p><h3><b>Is Bao Tranchi Married?</b></h3><p><span>Bao Tranchi didn‚Äôt seem to be married but she was in a relationship with Jeremy Woolsey in 2023.</span></p><p><span>Her partner, Jeremy Woolsey was born on May 5, 1973, in Mobile, Alabama, and today, he‚Äôs an art director and production designer known for his works on </span><i><span>Judas and the Black Messiah</span></i><span> (2021), </span><i><span>Hidden Figures </span></i><span>(2016), and </span><i><span>Pitch Perfect</span></i><span> (2012).
