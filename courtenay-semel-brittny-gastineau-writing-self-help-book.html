No Plastic Surgery Included</strong>.” The proposal, which is currently being shopped around, explains that the book is “the coming-to-terms story of two best friends who hit rock bottom and their step-by-step plan of taking their lives into their own hands.”</p><p>Semel, whose father is <strong>Yahoo!</strong>'s former chairman and CEO, has endured many ups and downs, including a rehab stint and the devastating loss of her beloved girlfriend, Casey Johnson. She recently enrolled in at a university to obtain her Master's in Psychology. Gastineau, on the other hand, who has a jewelry line, <strong>Tres Glam</strong>, with her mother Lisa, has had a more leveled life.</p><p>The book essentially suggests teaming up with one's BFF “at the hip,” and jointly seeking ways to better oneself, including visits to a nutritionist and personal trainer. And what about girls' night out? Well, keep it G-rated: “No alcohol is included during the next 30 days,” says the proposal. “If you can't cut the alc out, then you clearly have a problem.”</p><p>No word yet on whether Lindsay Lohan has placed an advance order for the book.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnF7kGlmaW5fmLy2vtOepZqxXaiyrrHLZpmroaSpu7p5xpqqraGemq62edaroK2hnpx6tLHLn2ShnZyleqO7zqRm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
