workers.</p><p>They who would ply their young victims with food, alcohol and cigarettes in return for sexual favours.</p><p>In 2006, Lancashire Police said Charlene had been murdered, but the force is still no closer to finding her body nearly two decades after she went missing.</p><p>Charlene's mum Karen last saw her on November 1, 2003, at 7.15pm.</p><img

Charlene was on her way to meet friends in the town centre.</p><p>Charlene told her she was going to the arcade and wouldn't be home late.</p><p>She met up with her friend and they then walked towards the Promenade, heading for the Carousel bar on North Pier.</p><p>Charlene is then spotted on CCTV just after 9pm outside a Blackpool bar on Talbot road with a woman wearing a three-quarter length black coat.</p><p>The next day when she failed to return home Charlene's family reported her as missing.</p><p>Officers from Lancashire Police took more than 4,800 witness statements and there have been 10,500 lines of inquiry generated during the length of the inquiry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

a £100,000 reward.</p><p>In 2007, a takeaway owner Iyad Albattikhi was accused of murdering her while co-worker Mohammed Reveshi was alleged to have helped to have dispose of her body.</p><p>At their trial the jury heard how Charlene's body had been was chopped up and turned into kebabs at Funny Boyz fast food shop in Blackpool.</p><p>It was believed that Charlene could have been targeted because

the jury failed to reach a verdict.</p><p>Lancashire Police renewed their appeal for information about Charlene's whereabouts on the 13th anniversary of her disappearance.</p><p>Detective Superintendent Andy Webster said in 2016: "It has been thirteen years since Charlene disappeared but we are as determined as ever to find her killer or killers."</p><p>Two men were also arrested and questioned by police for historic sex offences in 2017 but police confirmed there was no suggested direct link to Charlene.</p><p>In the same year detectives finally released the only CCTV footage of her on the day she vanished - after it lay unnoticed on police shelves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

bungled investigation as a probe was launched into "breach of duty."</p><p>Karen launched a lawsuit against the force in July 2017 seeking a public apology.</p><p>Police watchdog IPCC referred the case to the Lancashire Police Commissioner and the force's Professional Standards Department in November 2017.</p><p>In 2019 the heartbreaking case was featured on Channel 5 documentary, Vanished: The Murder of Charlene Downes where it re-examined the case in the hope new leads could be found.</p><p>There was more heartbreak for Charlene's family back in 2021 as her younger brother was found dead.</p><p>Robert Downes, 30, was found “in a pool of blood” at his Blackpool home on December 4, just a few hours after complaining of feeling unwell..</p><p>Robert, a father-of-four, had gone to a
