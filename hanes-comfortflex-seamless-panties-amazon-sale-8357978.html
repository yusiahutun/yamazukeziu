I always had at least one set in my underwear drawer. While I’ve graduated to a bit more of a streamline look in my adulthood, as a rule, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>I still gravitate toward underwear packs</a>. Call me a creature of habit, but those packs get me every single time — especially since <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>shopping for underwear</a> isn’t necessarily the most fun or exciting experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So it’s no wonder that the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hanes ComfortFlex Seamless Panties 6-Pack</a> got my attention. Considering I was already head over heels for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the brand’s wireless bra</a>, it only stands to reason I would need to try these, too. While they also come in boyshort and thong styles, I went for the bikini. The pack of six undies come in sizes S to XXL, with colors including nude, black, and rose pink.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They’re designed in a silky, stretch nylon and polyester blend that’s exceedingly soft and comfortable. Meanwhile, the four-way stretch fabric is, as you might guess, stretchy — it moves effortlessly, and fits easily over my curvy hips and waist. The fabric is also so seamless, it disappears under every fabric I’ve tried, from silk and satin to cotton and linen.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, Hanes underwear may not be equated with luxury, but for a basic bikini undie that’s seamless and super comfortable, it’s pretty hard to beat. I first picked up a pack on Amazon back in January; I’ve since purchased three more sets every time more colors are released. And it’s not because they stretch out over time — they actually retain their shape for months on end — it’s just because I love them that much. Not only that, I convinced my 74-year-old mom to buy them, and now she’s in love, too. I also bought the thong version, which is just as comfortable and supportive as the bikini.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">over 10,000 five-star ratings on Amazon</a>, my mom and I aren’t the only ones praising this underwear pack. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One shopper</a> said they’ve become their “go to undies” because they’re “breathable and comfortable.” Others said they “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">don’t ride up under jeans</a>,” “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">actually cover your butt</a>,” and “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">don’t move one bit all day</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Worried about whether <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">these Hanes undies</a> will show under your clothes? Shoppers almost unequivocally say yes. One called them “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">surprisingly seamless</a>,” while another said they’re “<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">so comfortable</a>” and can’t be seen under yoga pants.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In case you’re still on the fence about whether to add <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the Hanes ComfortFlex Seamless Panties 6-Pack</a> to your shopping cart, here’s something to sway you: They’re on sale for $16 — that’s less than $3 a pair. So, beat my mom and I to the panty punch and snap up a pack on Amazon while it’s discounted.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qlnqtdmLyuss6rq5%2Bkla16tLHApqOeq6NivaK606KcrGWRoq67u81mqpqklWKFdIGWcm5x</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
