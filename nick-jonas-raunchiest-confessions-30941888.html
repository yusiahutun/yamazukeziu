Demi Lovato.</p><p>Alongside their careers as actors, the group started releasing chart-topping hits which grabbed the attention of a loyal legion of fans all over the globe.</p><p>Aside from the music, the group are equally known for their joint decision to wear purity rings throughout their youth and young adulthood.</p><p>The rings acted as a symbol that they were abstaining from sex before marriage, before they individually decided to remove them in their own time as they got older.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30465794.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Joe-Jonas.jpg><p>Earlier this year, the group reflected on that period of their lives in a recent interview with Andy Cohen while appearing on Watch What Happens Live.</p><p>During a game of One, Two, Three, Agree or Disagree, the trio were asked if their purity rings were a “bad idea”.</p><p>In response to Cohen’s question, all three brothers held up a green sign which read “agree” as they shared their thoughts on the decision with hindsight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Nick pointed out how he didn’t know much about purity rings as a child, noting: “In theory, they’re not a bad idea but you should know what you’re signing up for before you sign up for it.”</p><p>Joe agreed, adding: “When you’re 12 versus when you’re like 16 is a very big difference.”</p><p>When the host asked the group when they officially stopped wearing the rings, Nick responded: “It just sort of happened”.</p><p>This isn't the first time the boys have spoken out against the decision to wear purity rings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

criticised some of the questions that he and his brothers got asked surrounding their purity rings and sex lives.</p><p>The singer told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Harper’s Bazaar</a>: “It became a defining factor of who we were as a band, which was disappointing.</p><p>“I was just trying to navigate love and romance and what sex even meant to me at a sensitive age.</p><p>"The question should have been: Is it appropriate for people to talk about a 16-year-old's sex life? It’s absolutely not – and it wouldn’t necessarily fly today.”</p><h3>First time regrets</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30942026.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_2008-Teen-Choice-Awards-Show.jpg><p>In 2020, Nick opened up about the first time he had sex to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Elle magazine</a> during their May issue, where he admitted how he had made one major error in the bedroom.</p><p>He told the publication that if he could turn back time he would change one thing about the experience – and it’s not what you may think.</p><p>The singer admitted that he accidentally picked a “depressing” dong to rock the boat to which made the memorable moment a little more uncomfortable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30942022.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_2008-MTV-Video-Music-Awards-Rehearsals.jpg><p>He explained: “I don’t want to say what song it was but my iPod was on shuffle. It was a bad draw.”</p><p>Since his solo career took off, the singer admitted he frequently finds it awkward when he thinks about “how many babies have been made to [his song] Jealous. They should be naming their babies Nick or Nicole.”</p><h3>Saucy bedroom Kinks</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30942078.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_BBC-Radio-1s-Big-Weekend-2023.jpg><p>But this wasn’t Nick Jonas’ first time being grilled on the Andy Cohen show, with the star baring all back in 2016 during the height of his solo career.</p><p>During the show, the TV host brought up a series of X-rated topics on Watch What Happens Love after the Close hitmaker admitted that he would “probably answer” if someone asked him what his fetishes were.</p><p>Throughout the show, the hunk was asked if he would be interested in “getting spanked” in the bedroom, which Nick jokingly revealed that he had a “firm a**.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30942085.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Jonas-Brothers-Five-Albums-One-Night-The-World-Tour-Las-Vegas-NV.jpg><p>The singer even teased fans with an insight into his 2006 relationship with fellow singer Miley Cyrus, admitting that he wasn’t too fond of being tied to a bed post because “it happened one time and it didn’t end well”.</p><p>Another kink he didn’t particularly enjoy in the bedroom was passionate hair pulling, as he reminded the late-night host that his hair is “very short” and would complicate things during the act.</p><h3>'Technically' gay sex</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30942034.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Nick-Jonas.jpg><p>In 2017, Nick Jonas confessed that he’s “technically” had gay sex while filming the TV sitcom Kingdom which follows the life of a mixed martial arts gym owner as he supports his sons and their problems.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Attitude</a> at the time, he told the publication that he has never struggled with his sexuality despite fans speculating online throughout his career.</p><p>He explained: “As me, Nick, I am very open about who I am and that I have nothing to prove. I know who I am, I've been honest about that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30942031.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_MTV-TRL-NEW-YORK-AMERICA-20-JUN-2006.jpg><p><b><i>Have you joined </i></b><b><i>Threads?

It is always this thing, have I, has Nick [had gay sex]? No. But it’s my lips, it’s my hands, it’s my body, even if I'm playing a character.</p><p>“So technically I have done that, so I wouldn’t say I haven’t because that would be lying."</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest s</i></b><b><i>howbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters </i></b><b><i><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>here</a>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlorKxlo528uK7Is2anoZOgequ7zZqqZqqRqruktMieqq1lk6S7p7HSrKCopqNienR8mG1ocXBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
