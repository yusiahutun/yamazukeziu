In the 90-minute-long episode titled "With Open Eyes," Kendall, Roman, and Shiv, the Roy siblings, clashed fiercely over the control of Waystar RoyCo amidst the tumultuous GoJo deal. What began as a united front against their father, Logan, quickly disintegrated after his death, with each sibling vying for their own ascent to power. As the tension escalated, unexpected alliances formed, betrayals unfolded, and the fate of the family empire hung in the balance.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>At the heart of the finale's shocking conclusion was the moment when Tom Wambsgans, the husband of Shiv, grabbed her hand. This unexpected gesture left viewers questioning its significance and the true motives behind it. To unravel this mystery, let's delve into several theories and examine the evidence for and against them.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>One theory posits that Tom's actions were driven by his ambition and desire for self-preservation. Throughout the series, Tom has showcased a relentless pursuit of success within the Roy family, often at the expense of his own integrity. Supporting this theory is Tom's conversation with Lukas Matsson, where he discovers that Matsson does not want Shiv as CEO and sees Tom as his "front man" for the impending power struggle. This revelation could have triggered Tom to take matters into his own hands and secure his position within the company. The fact that Tom becomes the new CEO of Waystar RoyCo further strengthens this theory, as it aligns with his long-standing aspirations.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>However, there are counterarguments to consider. Tom and Shiv share a complicated history, marked by genuine affection and a sense of camaraderie. Their relationship goes beyond mere ambition and power dynamics. Additionally, Tom has often displayed vulnerability and a deep-seated need for acceptance within the Roy family, making it questionable whether he would orchestrate such a calculated move against Shiv.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Examining the evidence for and against this theory allows us to explore the complex motivations that drive Tom's character. While his ambition and self-preservation may have played a role, it's important to consider the multifaceted nature of his relationship with Shiv and the potential influence of other factors in his decision-making.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Another theory surrounding the hand grab in the Succession finale revolves around Shiv's emotional state and her decision-making process. Throughout the series, Shiv has demonstrated a strong desire for power and recognition within the Roy family. In the boardroom vote scene, Shiv's emotional turmoil is palpable as she confronts Kendall about his denial of killing the cater waiter. This pivotal moment not only exposes Kendall's wavering commitment to their shared bond but also threatens the unity necessary for the siblings to secure control of Waystar RoyCo.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Supporting this theory is the idea that Shiv's ultimate betrayal of Kendall stems from her fear of losing her own chances at the top position. As the pressure intensifies and the realization sinks in that the fate of the family empire rests on her vote, Shiv may have succumbed to the temptation of preserving her own ambitions. It aligns with her pattern of betraying her family members when personal gain is at stake. However, it's essential to note that Shiv's decisions are not purely driven by self-interest. Her relationship with Tom and the potential long-term plans she might have for Waystar RoyCo introduce additional layers of complexity into her motivations.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Contrary to this theory, one might argue that Shiv's conflicting emotions and potential regret after the vote suggest a more nuanced rationale behind her actions. The depth of her connection with Kendall and the shared history they have might have left her torn between loyalty to her brother and the drive for personal success. Unraveling Shiv's emotional decision requires careful consideration of her character development throughout the series and the complex web of relationships she navigates.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>A theory rooted in symbolism and character development posits that the hand grab between Tom and Shiv holds deeper meaning within the context of Succession. Shiv's name itself, meaning "shiv" or a makeshift knife, suggests her propensity for betrayals and backstabbing. The act of Shiv "shivving" Kendall aligns with this notion, emphasizing her inclination to prioritize personal gain over familial bonds.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Another crucial aspect to consider is the siblings' reaction to Kendall's denial of killing the cater waiter. It's not the act of murder that horrifies Roman and Shiv, but rather Kendall's retraction of his confession, which shattered the bond they had formed in the Season 3 finale. This moment underscores the importance of unity among Logan Roy's children to secure their place as potential successors. By disavowing his confession, Kendall demonstrates a willingness to sever those ties if it means securing the crown.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>It's worth mentioning that the evolution of Tom and Shiv's dynamic throughout the series plays a significant role in understanding their actions in the finale. From Tom's initial role as the punching bag to their complex marital relationship, their connection is multifaceted. The hand grab could symbolize a newfound alliance or a recognition of shared goals, which might explain Shiv's subsequent congratulations to Tom. However, it is essential to acknowledge that there may be underlying motives or strategic moves behind Tom's actions that require further exploration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyjuM6gZrCgqWKxqrCMraamZZikuaV50qGgr6tdna6vsIyaq2asmJp6prrDZqafZaOqsKSx0qygqKY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
