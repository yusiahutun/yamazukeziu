The <a href=#>awards show</a> invites the general public and fans to vote for the winners, setting it apart from other big nights across the year that usually have a closed-off and anonymous panel vote. However, in his podcast last month, <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> said it was ‘nonsense’ that he was up on the bill. Now, he’s won, but fans are saying it’s only because of his girlfriend <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-called-his-people-s-choice-awards-nomination-nonsense>Travis Kelce called his People’s Choice Awards nomination ‘nonsense’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2013535747-1024x683.jpg><p>On his New Heights podcast, which the 34-year-old records with older brother <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a>, Trav couldn’t get his head around it.</p><p>He called it “f****** nonsense”, as he was up against icons like LeBron James, Lionel Messi, Simone Biles and Coco Gauff.</p><p>The nominations were announced long before he and the <a href=#>Chiefs won the Super Bowl gam</a>e last week.</p><p>In January, when discussing the nod, he said: “How am I on this?</p><p>“What did I do to get Athlete of the Year?
