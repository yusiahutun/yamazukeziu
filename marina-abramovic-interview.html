"Do I want the men to serve us topless – maybe in shorts?" she ponders. "What is your opinion?" Before I can proffer a view, she begins elaborating on her plans for the event in question: a private afternoon tea for more than 100 high-profile female guests – "politicians, scientists, writers, strong women from fashion, cinema, the arts" – to be served by men in the hallowed halls of the Royal Academy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The venue is significant, and is the reason we are speaking today, a few months before the New York-based Serbian artist travels to London to mark yet another milestone in her five-decade career: becoming the first woman in the Royal Academy’s 255-year history to have a solo show in its main galleries. For Abramović, who once made headlines for claiming she was "not a feminist artist" (on the grounds that all great art is created equal), taking part in this historic exhibition has prompted something of a change of heart.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Harper's Bazaar, 'Women In Art'" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/abramovic-1603270745.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I first started working with performance art, it wasn’t even seen as a form of art, so I didn’t care whether it was made by a man or a woman. I was just doing my best to enter the mainstream," she explains. "Now that has really happened, but I’m getting confronted more and more with how many restrictions women have faced over the centuries. It’s unthinkable that, at the Royal Academy, so many incredible women artists have never been given the big space to present their work – even Tracey Emin only got the small gallery. So I felt a lot of pressure to deliver the best show of my life."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I feel like a superhero, like every day is a miracle and I have to be in the present all the time. That's how I'm living now"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She has had more time than anticipated to prepare for the show, given it was originally scheduled to run in 2020 – but the pandemic got in the way. "I was actually very lucky that it didn’t happen, because I’ve been able to really think about, and create, the exhibition I want, which is not a retrospective at all," she says. "I didn’t want to look at my work chronologically, but in a fresh way that tells a story about the journey of making. I’ve mixed pieces from the Sixties and Seventies with new ones because the ideas aren’t linear; they spiral, and sometimes the mind goes in a spiral, too – you might think of something in the past, and two seconds later you think about something in the future. And this is exactly what the show is going to look like."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The impact that Abramović has had on the contemporary-art scene cannot be underestimated. She brought what she calls "long-durational performance" – in which the artist suffers some element of hardship in the name of creativity – to both public and critical attention, transforming it from a misunderstood niche practice into a genre recognised for its artistic merit and popular interest. In her early Rhythms series, made in Belgrade between 1973 and 1974, she tested her body’s mental and physical limits by variously stabbing knives between the fingers of her outstretched palm, taking pills that induced severe muscle seizures, and lying in the centre of a burning five-point star (a symbol of the communist movement) to the point of unconsciousness. Looking back at these works, two of which will be shown as films at the Royal Academy, Abramović says that she is astounded by her own resilience. "I’m impressed by how much courage I had when I was so young – how uncompromising I was when I was being attacked from all sides," she reflects. Even her romantic relationships became public property, most famously in 1988, when she and her then long-term partner, the German performance artist Ulay, embarked on an epic walk along the Great Wall of China, which culminated in the end of their love affair. "It was unbelievably difficult," she says, "the separation, every-thing about it."</p><img alt="marina abramovic" title="Marina Abramovic" width=2539 height=3425 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/feature-marina-abramovic-6518212115897.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christopher Sturman</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her self-flagellating urge has diminished over the years. "Once, I was literally ready to die for art – I’m not prepared to do that anymore, definitely not," she says. A recent health scare has only strengthened this view: after a routine knee operation in April left her with severe medical complications, she spent weeks in hospital and twice came close to dying. Strangely for an artist who has so often confronted her own mortality in her work (for a 2012 film, she teamed up with the director Robert Wilson and the actor Willem Dafoe to make the experimental opera The Life and Death of Marina Abramović, and in 2015 she publicly announced plans for her own funeral), she found herself completely unprepared for the experience. "It was really shocking and dramatic," she admits, "like the universe was saying to me, OK, you want to see what real dying looks like? Here it is." Nonetheless – and this is consistent with what she has always described as her essentially optimistic outlook on the world – the prospect of death has left her even more determined to live. "I feel like a superhero, like everyday is a miracle and I have to be in the present all the time," she says. "That’s how I’m living now."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With her 77th birthday approaching inNovember, Abramovic ́ is unafraid of ageing but resolved to keep herself in the best possible health. She has fully embraced the wellness industry: a long-term practitioner of mindfulness and meditation, she previously designed a spa in collaboration with the artist James Turrell, last year released a boxed set of 'instruction cards' to train people in the art of reaching a higher consciousness, and is currently collaborating with the Austrian doctor Nonna Brenner on a range of products to promote longevity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This preoccupation with wellbeing might seem unlikely given how often she has put her own at risk for the sake of art, but Abramović says her interests are "two sides of the same coin". "It’s the worst thing to be old and sick, but to be old and healthy is incredible," she explains. "I don’t want to go back to my thirties and forties, when I was suffering so much – I like being who I am now, because I have wisdom that I didn’t have before, that you can only get with age." She points to her seminal 2010 performance The Artist is Present, for which she spent eight hours a day over the course of nearly three months sitting silently at a wooden table locking eyes with anyone who came to sit opposite her, as an example of this. "I made that when I was 65... I could never have made it at 30, because I didn’t have the willpower, the stamina, the concentration," she says. "I have all of that now, and I want to enjoy it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Enjoying it means focusing on new projects that excite her – because, in her words, "at this time of life, you have to be very careful not to make any bullshit; just to do things that really matter". She hopes to produce a new dance work – "my own version of The Rite of Spring" – and is currently returning to her roots by delving deeper into the research she did into folk culture for her 2005 work Balkan Erotic Epic ("I’m studying the sexual life of gypsies – there are so many books to read...").</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Equally important to her is preserving her legacy by nurturing the next generation of performance artists: in 2007, she established the Marina Abramović Institute, through which she trains young people interested in studying and practising her chosen art form; her programme of workshops is designed to prepare participants both physically and mentally for the high-intensity experiences they will face. This autumn, the Royal Academy will host a number of performances featuring new artists enacting some of Abramović’s most challenging past works, such as 2002’s The House with the Ocean View, for which she spent 12 days living in three specially constructed units while observing a strict fasting regime. Elsewhere, she and other performers will take over the Southbank Centre for five days of live presentations.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Abramović’s eagerness to develop the talents of novice artists reflects her unshakeable faith that our collective future lies in the hands of the young. "I’m fed up of my generation – they’re always tired, always complaining, there’s always something wrong," she says. "I’m lucky that my work resonates much more with young people – I think because they have this sixth sense that what I’m doing is real, that I’m dealing directly with emotions." She is particularly proud of the youth appeal of her opera 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, which premiered in Munich in 2020 and is showing at the English National Opera this November. "If somebody had told me, 10 years ago, I’d do opera, I’d have said, you’re crazy – who goes to the opera? Just old people! But then I thought, let’s break the rules, let’s find a way for young people to participate." 7 Deaths, which reimagines the various tragic ends met by characters Callas depicted throughout her career as a soprano, lasts just an hour and 36 minutes, features costumes designed by Abramović's great friend Riccardo Tisci and has sold out in every city in which it has toured. "The best compliment I got was when two old ladies came to see it at Opéra Garnier in Paris," recounts Abramović with a twinkle in her eye. "They looked at each other and said, 'Mais c’est pas classique!'."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"To be old and healthy is incredible. I like being who I am now, because I have wisdom that I didn’t before, that you can only get with age"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She takes a similar delight in experimenting with non-'classical' media in her art, subverting even her own expectations with some of her recent projects. Originally sceptical about the relevance of NFTs to her artistic practice, fearing that they were just a licence to print money, Abramović was last year persuaded to make her first foray into the metaverse, collaborating with the Piccadilly Circus-based art-platform Circa. She turned her 2001 film The Hero, in which she sits proudly astride a white horse to commemorate her father’s courage fighting the Nazis in former Yugoslavia, into a series of digital frames designed to inspire heroism in a divided society; a proportion of the profits went to provide grants and scholarships to artists working with next-generation technologies. Virtual art, she believes, is only in its infancy: "We need time to understand the medium, to understand technology, and we have to be open to that." She is particularly interested in the potential of combining different media to add new dimensions to the art of performance. "I think mixed reality is absolutely the future," she says. "How will it change the way we see theatre pieces or watch cinema? We’re just at the beginning of all this."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Abramović's willingness to explore a multiplicity of art forms is underpinned by her conviction that creativity drives progress, no matter how that manifests itself. "I think you can divide human beings into two categories: originals and the ones who follow," she says. "Originals are people who invent things – they could be astronauts or scientists, in art or film-making or fashion." This is one of the reasons why she finds herself drawn to the world of haute couture, contrary to the conventions of the society in which she was brought up, in which artists were expected to wear plain clothing so as not to detract from the seriousness of their oeuvre. "I don’t see fashion as just fashion – what matters is whether it’s created by an original," she argues. Ever since she met Tisci, who has created countless pieces over the years for the woman he once described as his "soulmate", she has perceived clothes as a source of inspiration and self-esteem. "Everything changed after I got to know Riccardo," she says, pointing out that she is currently wearing one of his early shirt designs for Burberry. "Although as an artist I’m very secure about myself, as a woman I actually used to be very shy – I always thought I had a big nose, that my legs and knees weren’t great... Then he started making stuff for me and I found that confidence."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She has certainly never lost conviction in her ability to create and perform. "You know, people say to me, when are you going to stop?" she muses. "But artists never stop, artists just die working." If anyone can be relied upon to show superhuman powers of endurance, it is surely Marina Abramović.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Marina Abramovic ́’ is at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Royal Academy" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Royal Academy</a> from 23 September 2023 until 1 January 2024.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSvosbAmqlmmaKpfKKAlGlvcXFpbXyurdGipZplkZe%2FornOr6CcZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
