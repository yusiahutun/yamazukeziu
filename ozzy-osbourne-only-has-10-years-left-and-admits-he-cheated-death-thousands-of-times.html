Rock star Ozzy also explained his wife Sharon Osbourne recently chewed him out for recently using drugs.</strong></p><p>The 74-year-old spoke about “not fearing death” and explained that he didn’t want to live a “long, painful and miserable existence.”</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-460309386-1024x722.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ozzy-osbourne-was-told-off-by-sharon-over-drugs>Ozzy Osbourne was told off by Sharon over drugs</h2><p>The <a href=#>music</a> icon said that with his illnesses, including Parkinson’s disease, he will only live for “10 years at best.” But Ozzy Osbourne also admitted that when he used drugs recently, his wife wasn’t happy.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>explained</a> to Rolling Stone that when he told his wife, Sharon Osbourne, that he had “smoked a joint” recently, she became angered telling him it’d kill him. “I said, ‘How long do you want me to f***ing live for?!’ At best, I’ve got ten years left and when you’re older, time picks up speed.”</p><p>The Black Sabbath legend also said that he had cheated death and “should have been dead a thousand times.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong><a href=#> Bruce Lee’s death was tragic but his son’s fate was even more devastating</a></p><p>“Sometimes I look in the mirror and go, ‘Why the f*** did you make it?!’ I’m not boasting about any of it because I should have been dead a thousand times,” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said. “I’ve had my stomach pumped God knows how many times.”</p><p>Though Ozzy Osbourne said he doesn’t fear death when the time comes, he wants it to be over “quickly.”</p><p>“I like the idea that if you have a terminal illness, you can go to a place in Switzerland and get it done quickly.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-switzerland-pact-between-ozzy-and-sharon>Switzerland pact between Ozzy and Sharon</h2><p>Sharon, 71, has been open over the years about a suicide pact that she has with her husband of over 40 years. She <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> The Mirror in 2007 that if either of them got a disease like Alzheimer’s they would go to Switzerland where people can legally die by assisted suicide.</p><p>She said about the pact between the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a>: “Ozzy and I have absolutely come to the same decision. We believe 100 per cent in euthanasia so have drawn up plans to go to the assisted suicide flat in Switzerland if we ever have an illness that affects our brains. If Ozzy or I ever got Alzheimer’s, that’s it – we’d be off.”</p><p>Later, in an episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Osbourne’s podcast</a>, which the couple host alongside their children Kelly and Jack, Sharon said: “Do you think that we’re gonna suffer?” she asked her son. “Mental suffering is enough pain without physical. So if you’ve got mental and physical, see ya.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ozzy-says-living-with-parkinson-s-is-agony>Ozzy says living with Parkinson’s is ‘agony’</h2><p>Ozzy only went public with his Parkinson’s diagnosis in 2020 but revealed he’d been battling it for over 15 years.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a> last year, he said that the disease – which affects the nervous system, with one of the main symptoms being a tremor in the hands – caused him to suffer from “nerve pain” due to his condition.</p><p>“With the pressing on the spinal column, I got nerve pain. I’d never f***ing heard of nerve pain! You know when you’re a kid, and you’re playing with snow and your hands get really cold? Then you go in and you pour on hot water, and they start getting warm? And you get those chills? And it f***ing hurts? It’s like that.”</p><p>“It got so bad that at one point I thought: ‘Oh God, please don’t let me wake up tomorrow morning.’ Because it was f***ng agony.”</p><p><strong>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.
