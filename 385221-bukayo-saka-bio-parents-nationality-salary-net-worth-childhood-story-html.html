As the child of immigrants, he had his share of challenges. For example, choosing football as a <a href=#>career </a>path was hard because football academies are expensive across the UK. Luckily, he managed to get through, becoming part of the Arsenal U23 and the senior team.</p><p class=align-left>Where is Bukayo Saka from? He is from London, in the United Kingdom. However, Bukayo Saka's parents moved to the UK <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">from Nigeria</a> before he was born. Even though the footballer rarely talks about his personal life, he has spoken about his nationality. He is British, and he is proud to play for the English national team.</p><p class=align-left>Although it is a norm for footballers to appear at events with their girlfriends, the young player is always alone. Therefore, it is hard to ascertain whether Bukayo Saka is dating or not.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Alex Kompo: Former Siesta Key star's life and latest updates</span></p></a><h3>Profession</h3><p class=align-left>The Arsenal midfielder is undoubtedly one of the most promising players in the English Premier League. Many football commentators have nicknamed him "the next Cesc Fabregas" due to his talent and impressive statistics at junior Arsenal teams.</p><h4>Arsenal U23 appearance</h4><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Freddie Ljungberg</a>, the then coach at Arsenal Academy, saw Bukayo's potential. So when the Arsenal U23 team was restructuring, the young player was given a contract. Playing for this junior team gave him exposure, especially as a midfielder and a game maker.</p><h4>As an Arsenal midfielder</h4><p class=align-left>Bukayo Saka currently plays for Arsenal FC. His first game for the senior team was a match against Vorskla Poltava in the 2018 Europa League. Although he was a substitute to Aaron Ramsey, he retained the team strength, which gave Arsenal three goals to zero.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ca8640b3489c08df.jpeg><p class=align-left>Since then, the midfielder has become a key player under the current coach — Mikel Arteta. During the Bukayo Saka contract signing, the manager <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">praised him</a> as one of Arsenal's key players. Bukayo is also the youngest player to play in the first team since Cesc Fabregas.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a134e33615cbe6f7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dolvett Quince biography: wife, children, family, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although he is a playmaker, he scored his first goal for Arsenal on October 5th, 2020 — against Sheffield United. With a long contract in place, Bukayo has a chance to prove his skills and become the next elite footballer.</p><h4>International appearances for England</h4><p class=align-left>Before getting a spot in the senior team in 2020, he played for the Arsenal and England junior teams (England U18 and U19). However, getting a place in the two football teams is not as competitive as the senior squad. Nonetheless, it was a chance to prove to talent scouts and football fans that he is a reliable midfielder.</p><p class=align-left>Which country does Bukayo Saka play for? Many fans had imagined Bukayo Saka in Ghana or <a href=#>Nigeria</a>'s national team jersey. He has the freedom to make the switch in the future.
