Indeed, it’s possible to watch horses speeding along the gallops through a pair of binoculars as you breakfast in the oak-panelled restaurant, though the hotel also has a direct path through its grounds to the stadium and can also organise chauffeur-driven Bentleys to take racegoers to the meets in style.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following an extensive refurbishment, just in time for Cheltenham’s prestigious Gold Cup steeplechase this spring, Ellenborough’s 61 bedrooms have been sympathetically refreshed by local designer, Ilze Reinke, with inspiration taken from original Nina Campbell wallpapers as well as the natural hues of the Cotswolds. Historic elements still abound, though: the 1485 front door bears bullet holes gained during the Civil War, and Tudor roses still adorn many of its stained-glass windows.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you like a more private stay, the newly launched one-bedroom Lodge is like having your own, personal Cotswolds cottage for the night. In the main hotel, suites are named after illustrious thoroughbreds, making them a favourite with racehorse owners and superstar jockeys. If you’ve had a successful day at the races, book into the imposing Istabraq suite, named for the legendary three-time winner of Cheltenham’s Champion Hurdle race, with its luxurious four-poster bed, enormous marble bathroom and spectacular views. There’s even a secret passageway into the library, which can be transformed into a private dining room should you want to celebrate your winnings in serene seclusion.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Otherwise, a post-race evening is best spent in the hotel’s cosy but well-appointed spa, where a combination of jacuzzi bubbles and expert massage will soothe even the most jangled nerves. You could even opt for the Spa Garden Retreat, which is inspired by the Chelsea Flower Show and includes private access, champagne and a tempting array of treatments. Afterwards, slip into one of the comfy banquettes in the newly refitted Horse Box Brasserie and tuck into the seasonal menu (the roasted turbot with saffron and fennel and salted caramel tart are both winning options), or sip a classic cocktail – expertly blended by the hotel’s team of mixologists – at the lively bar.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you fancy taking your enthusiasm to the next level, the hotel offers exclusive tours of nearby Jackdaws Castle, home of the renowned racing trainer Jonjo O’Neill. Guests can take personal tours of one of the most sophisticated coaching centres in Europe and watch thoroughbreds at work on the gallops, or being pampered in their own therapeutic pool and solarium. Should the thrill of ownership prove too much of a temptation, you can even buy shares in young, up-and-coming racehorses. Who knows, perhaps the next Cheltenham champion could be your very own?</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From £299 per night (inc. VAT) for a 'Cosy Double' room, including breakfast.
