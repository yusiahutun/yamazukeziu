The 6-song project — available for advance listen exclusively on Taste of Country — leans into fiddle and steel, bulls and broncs, and heartache.</p><p>The Texas Regional Radio Report chart-topper "Spur of the Moment" begins Rodeo Queen. Frey, a Louisiana native, adds her untamed vocals to an unrequited love story that's more fun than mournful. When she released the song as a single earlier this year, Frey put her father Billie riding his bronco at Cheyenne Frontier Days on the single cover. Growing up she chased rodeo dreams herself, even winning a&nbsp;Louisiana High School state goat tying championship in 2011.</p><p>Acoustic guitar grooves&nbsp;two-step&nbsp;with slide guitar across the big dreaming "Two Dollar Billionaire," a funky co-write (one of five) for Frey. The heart of the album comes next, with a tender vocal performance on "Rodeo Queen" and a sincere cover of an '80s pop hit. The title track could be described as a heartbroken extrovert's tragedy. Find her feelings buried deep under the chords and fiddle cries as she repeats, "I'm a rodeo queen without a crown."&nbsp;</p><p>If you've ever wondered&nbsp;what Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" sounds like as a country song, Frey has your answer. The gypsy anthem "I Do Thing" and personal "Horses In Heaven" close the EP, the latter tributing her late grandfather and bookending a project that is unabashedly country.</p><p>Frey has four chart-toppers on the Texas chart and has continued to come hard charging after appearing on the USA network's Real Country, a show she credits with helping her find a way to her true voice.</p><p>Rodeo Queen will be <a href=#>available at all digital retailers and streaming providers</a> on Friday (Oct. 23). "The Rodeo Queen EP is a tip of the hat to my rodeo roots," Frey says. "I hope my fans enjoy these stories as much as I did living them."</p><p><strong>Songs from Women&nbsp;in Country You Need to Hear In 2021:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpLGcnrJustGesGaqn5mysHnQrpyepl2avXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
