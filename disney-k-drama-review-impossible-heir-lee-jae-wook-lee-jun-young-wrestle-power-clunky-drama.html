She is the romantic interest who draws the attention of the male leads and inadvertently drives a wedge between them before they eventually go down their separate paths.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In practice, however, it never feels that way. Hye-won is a flat character who shares no chemistry with the leads, yet who, beyond her failure as a romantic device, serves no function in the narrative – so much so that in the last two episodes she barely appears on screen.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She is never fully integrated into the story and the show’s writers didn’t know what to do with her, beyond having her reappear at the end and look wistfully up at the sky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/257a32de-75bd-4a7f-aaaf-243e209b423d_c98dc12f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once Tae-o and In-ha become enemies, with Tae-o painted as the hero to In-ha’s villain, the narrative becomes a face-off between them. It’s no longer a question of whether they can take over Kangoh, it’s a question of who among them will pull it off and at what cost.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The power struggle happens in the wake of the death of Kang In-ju (Han Sang-jin), the firstborn son of company chairman Kang Joong-mo (Choi Jin-ho).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When Joong-mo ends up in a coma after collapsing for the umpteenth time, a boardroom reshuffle is required – new alliances need to be formed as Tao-o and In-ha forge links with the remaining Kangoh family members.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tae-o’s alliance is the one that makes the most sense. Following the death of his mother – which caps a woefully underdeveloped subplot – he is approached at her funeral by Joong-mo’s second son Kang Seong-ju (Lee Ji-hoon).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/4b9b3f43-e661-49b8-8864-1024b3ef3b7e_d046ebac.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Seong-ju has also just lost his mother, who is currently behind bars – and the instigator of this and the death of Tae-o’ s mother is In-ha.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By contrast, In-ha’s alliance is both perfunctory and highly illogical. It is forged during a scene in which he meets Jung Ji-sun (Lee Seo-an), In-ju’s widow, in her art gallery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They stand in front of a landscape painting and she explains that people and paintings cannot be figured out through their appearance alone. She adds that details can be overlooked only to later be rediscovered. She confusingly concludes that her point is about looking into the future.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">7 of the best new Korean drama series to watch in April 2024</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although he hasn’t yet gone to prison for it, In-ha ordered the death of Ji-sun’s husband; this scene is meant to demonstrate their cautious alliance as In-ha attempts to consolidate power to achieve his ultimate ambition, taking control of Kangoh.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Why Ji-sun would side with outcast In-ha over her brother-in-law Seong-ju is never explained, and this is the last time she speaks in the series.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not surprisingly, the victor in the battle for control of Kangoh turns out to be Tae-o, who takes control with Joong-mo’s blessing, while In-ha briefly rots in prison before taking his own life.</p>Curiously, following the conclusion of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Flex X Cop</span></a>, this is the second show in as many weeks that has ended with an illegitimate heir becoming a villain.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/05/7781906e-5c56-4354-920e-5175b504cf1d_f2ec61f5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To its credit, The Impossible Heir did finish in better form than it began. After winnowing all the chaff, including Hye-won, and tightening up its narrative, there remained a mostly clear story to follow as the show rushed towards its climax.</p>Was this conclusion strong enough to save the show as a whole? Alas, the damage had already been done in what has proven to be Disney+’s first major dud after a strong run of K-dramas since last summer, beginning with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Moving</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Impossible Heir is streaming on Disney+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRllKeurq2OmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkW5ucmhoZLGqv82esGajXZm%2FornAZqmerpmaxG61zKmmrKuZl7mmeceeoKtlnJqybrbAnmSwp5%2Bgeq2xxGahrqZdrry2usZmrqudo6m5pnnPqK6eql2Yuba6yrJknaqRoq4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
