According to Luu, Almased fuels the body with a unique complex of amino acids — including all nine essential amino acids — which are crucial for maintaining our health and metabolism. These include:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Histidine: Helps with cell regeneration and repairing damaged tissue</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isoleucine: Regulates blood glucose levels, which influence insulin demand, thereby the body’s ability to break down stored fat</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leucine: Prevents muscle loss and improves muscle gain, impacting metabolism</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lysine: Helps with wound healing and exhibits antiviral effects on the body</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methionine: Improves immune function</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Threonine: Maintains gut integrity and function</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tryptophan: Serves as a precursor for vitamin B6 and serotonin (a neurotransmitter that controls mood and sleep). It also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Phenylalanine: Affects mood and emotions by serving as a precursor for norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine</p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valine: Assists in making other amino acids, glutamine and alanine</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/Figure-Plan-Plus-Brochure-rendering.jpg><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td>Need help with your diet?
