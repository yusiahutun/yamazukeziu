My first line of defense against oil and sweat&nbsp;is lightly blotting with the extra napkin I grabbed along with my iced coffee on my way to work. And while it soaks up a little condensation, it also smudges my makeup, ruining the finish of my foundation, blush and bronzer. It’s been beyond annoying, but I haven’t exactly had another choice—until now.</p><p>I’ve discovered a new blotting tool that’s totally changing the game. Beauty Blender,&nbsp;the company that brought you your<i>&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;</i>sponge makeup applicator, has launched a reusable product just for blotting. It goes by the very fancy name of <strong>Blotterazzi</strong> ($20 for 2, <a href=# rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>), and it’s a raindrop-shaped sponge cushion that you lightly tap on your face to blot shine where needed. They’re super flexible and thin, so you can really get into those strange spots—above your lips, on the side of the nose—where oil seems to sit. It’s basically the most glamorous way to do the least glamorous thing, and I’m obsessed with it. How many people can honestly say that they love blotting their skin? Because&nbsp;now, I really do.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/revivecollagenreview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ashley-review.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p>The best feature of the product is that it’s reusable. Just like a makeup brush, you can wash this product and rinse out all the dirt and grime so that you can use it over and over again. I hate&nbsp;having used blotting papers or napkins floating around in my handbag, so this is a total draw for me—I just rinse, let it dry, pop it back in its handy case and throw it back in my purse. And because they’re reusable, these little pads are definitely a more environmentally-friendly option. Why make more trash just because the heat won’t quit?</p><p>When I was testing the blotterazzi, I made it a point to check&nbsp;the sponge for signs of makeup transfer, and I was pleasantly surprised. My makeup&nbsp;actually stayed on my face like it’s supposed to—and the only thing that was taken away&nbsp;was the shine. It also didn’t add any powdery residue to my skin, which is something I hate. Each little compact comes with two different blotterazzi pads, and they’re said to last for 60 days each. That’s 120 days I’ll be shine-free during my commute, giving me an even better reason to have fun with&nbsp;my makeup in the morning. Grease&nbsp;has never been less of an issue.</p><p><strong>More From Daily Makeover: <a href=#>A Spray for Nixing Shiny Skin Before It Happens</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWSCd4GPaWlompWWwrXFwaWcp5yVp3qjuM6tq56qka%2FHqnnRnq2inadk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
