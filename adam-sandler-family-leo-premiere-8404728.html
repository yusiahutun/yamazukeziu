It goes without saying that their patriarch Adam is a comedy legend, but this year, his wife and daughters joined him (to rave reviews) on the big screen in the hit Netflix dramedy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah</a>. Now, the family has done it again with their new animated flick Leo, which drops on Netflix Nov. 21.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The crew promoted the film as a unit at its Los Angeles premiere on Sunday at the Westwood Regency Village Theater. The comedian arrived in his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>signature lackadaisical style</a>, which included an indigo-and-white golf polo with a floral and tropical cocktail print layered under a blue striped zip-up hoodie. On the bottom, Adam wore gray sweatpants and black sneakers.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, his family went in a different direction with their style, with all three Sandler girls sporting more classic red carpet getups. His wife Jackie wore a black-and-white, off-the-shoulder minidress styled with matching flats and a quilted clutch. The couple's eldest daughter, Sadie, wore an emerald green spaghetti strap midi dress, but she did take a page from her father's fashion book by pairing her formal dress with white platform high-top Converse. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sunny</a> opted for a champagne-colored strapless maxidress paired with matching heeled sandals.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the streaming platform, the animation follows a "lizard named Leo [played by Adam] in this coming-of-age musical comedy about the last year of elementary school as seen through the eyes of a class pet." Bill Burr and Cecily Strong star alongside the Sandlers in the new movie, which is directed by Robert Marianetti, Robert Smigel, and David Wachtenheim and produced by Adam's production company Happy Madison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wJ2YpmWjlruluMSrZJ%2BZnZ65unnLnqZmqKKauqqx0Z5kcWxgaYRzhA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
