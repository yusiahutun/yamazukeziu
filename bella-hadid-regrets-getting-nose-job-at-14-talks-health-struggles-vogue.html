"I think I would have grown into it."</p><p>Bella went on to address rumors in which she's been accused of bringing photos of supermodel Carla Bruni into the plastic surgeon's office as well as "getting her eyes lifted," "jaw shaved" and "lips filled." The 25-year-old denied that she's had any of the procedures, pointing out how people have cited a photo of her as a teen to claim that she's had work done.</p><p>"People think I fully f---ed with my face because of one picture of me as a teenager looking puffy. I'm pretty sure you don't look the same now as you did at 13, right?" Bella told Vogue. "I have never used filler. Let's just put an end to that. I have no issue with it, but it's not for me. Whoever thinks I've gotten my eyes lifted or whatever itâ€™s called -- it's face tape! The oldest trick in the book."</p><p>Also in the profile, Bella opened up about physical and mental health struggles, including depression, anxiety and Lyme disease, as well as body image issues.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5375b58e-91ad-4f48-aacb-752de86cc9ea data-container-ref=toofab:article:4f201bb0-5327-44cf-b2c8-e27db1c82765 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bc/5by4/2021/11/09/bc2f436d2d5a4633bca4e5f67f9ec1d7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Crying Bella Hadid Opens Up About Anxiety Struggles: 'Pretty Much My Everyday'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She said that for three years she would wake up crying, and would find herself doing the same in almost all of her private moments.</p><p>The model said that in January 2021, she experienced burnout.
