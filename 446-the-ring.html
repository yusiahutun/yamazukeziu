Laurel Mercantile</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>I loved this ring so much, I dreamed about it after Ben and I first saw it. We were so excited to first go around the square in Oxford, looking at rings and daydreaming about being married, even though we knew we wouldn’t be able to for a couple more years. We found “the one” here in Laurel, and I knew it the moment I saw it. I didn’t make a fuss, I didn’t want him to feel pressured at all. I didn’t realize Ben would put a down payment on it a few days later. I didn’t realize what he was sacrificing to give me that one little piece of jewelry some day. It took him a long time, and we were in no hurry. The day he proposed, I cried and I cried and I cried with joy. I stared at my hand for long stretches of time wondering if this could possibly be my real life. I still see it and feel my heart skip a beat when I remember what that sweet boy did to make me his wife. It was a huge purchase for a college kid, a huge step toward the rest of our lives.</p><p>Tonight, Emily used her fancy ring cleaning machine to shine it up and I saw it again with new eyes. It’s so very special to me. I really need to write ole Benny boy a thank you note for it one of these days.</p><a onblur=try{parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully()}catch(e){} href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/journal.laurelmercantile.com/uploads/2011/03/Picture-212.png border=0 alt id=BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5586750190995477074 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7ra3Uq5ylpZWnsKK606KjnmaTpLpwrsuonqxnmqTCs7rApWZtbGZiwamxjKugp58%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
