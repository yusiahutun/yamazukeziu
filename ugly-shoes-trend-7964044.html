Instead, she chose the Robin boot, a lug-soled leather slab from The Row that resembles orthopedic workwear and costs roughly half the average American mortgage. The shoes are equal parts strange and amazing; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>they are also sold out</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift isn’t the only one swapping dainty footwear for something ... less pretty. At New York Fashion Week, hot tickets like Proenza Schouler and 3.1 Phillip Lim styled their models in wide mesh flats that resembled lobster nets. Flouncy princess skirts from the Hollywood It label Staud came with flattened shoe-socks. (Imagine old-school Keds run over by a car.) And at the Gen Z favorite Collina Strada, creative director Hillary Taymour collaborated with Ugg on chunky Mary Janes with threateningly cool spikes at the heel and toe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Taymour called the shoes “fearless and dressed for a smile.” We'd offer a different designation: The latest in a long line of clompers labeled simply “The Ugly Shoe.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Crocs Siren Clog.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hannah Rosa Lewis-Lopes</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-rise-and-rise-of-the-ugly-shoe></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Rise (and Rise...) of the "Ugly" Shoe</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beauty is expansive, and nothing is “ugly” except blind hatred and the way my hair looks when I run out of Kerastase. But that’s okay because “The Ugly Shoe” isn’t unattractive, per se; it’s just weird, unfamiliar, and more challenging to the eye than a sleek stiletto. In the words of fashion stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Masha Orlov</a>, who began her career modeling for Zac Posen before going behind the scenes with brands like Dior and Nordstrom, “the size and beauty of your heel used to represent your female power. They would say, ‘My heels are bigger than your dick!’ But that all changed a few years ago… Now ugly is good. Sometimes, it can be great.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Maison Margiela Tabi</a>, a shoe with a separate space for the big toe, which was arguably the first official “Ugly” footwear to take off and an IYKYK symbol of the style elite. After debuting in 1988, the shoe became a favorite of Paris’ emerging designers, including future fashion superstars like Raf Simons, the co-creative director at Prada.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the mid-1990s, the Tabi had been reimagined as a boot and a heel — and embraced by front-row royalty like Chloë Sevigny and Sarah Jessica Parker. In 2021, they became downright mainstream, as Kim Kardashian flashed the Tabi x Reebok collection on her Instagram. Now <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Olivia Rodrigo</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dua Lipa</a> wear them in paparazzi snaps. Fashion writer Arabella Sicardi called the Tabi “the most divisive thing I own” on the retail site<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow> Ssense</a>, where pairs can be purchased for more than $1,200. Over Labor Day Weekend, designer Alexis Dougé went viral on TikTok when she revealed a Tinder date had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4>stolen her beloved Tabis</a> while visiting her apartment. They were later returned to the owner at Grand Central Station.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Why does the Tabi still hold sway? “They’re the ultimate eff you to people who don’t get fashion,” says Amy Evans, 19, a New York design student who recently bought her first pair after saving up since her Bat Mitzvah. “Or people who are like, ‘Girls should wear pretty things.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That rebellious streak helps give some “Ugly” shoes their legs. Anti-heels have long signified a silent protest of girly glamour, especially in times of cultural upheaval. Take the ‘60s, when traditional round pumps were dumped for square-toed silver platforms, and the ‘90s, when Gen X raised their voices for human rights and clean energy as Donna Martin crossed the graduation stage in a pair of scuffed Doc Martens. In both cases, shoes were used to stomp all over the idea that women’s clothes should be “pretty” above all else.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Nike Shox MR4 X Martine Rose.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hannah Rosa Lewis-Lopes</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, several “Ugly” shoes have piqued the style industry’s interest — the Alexander McQueen “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Armadillo heel</a>” of 2010, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Marc Jacobs 2012 pilgrim loafer</a>, and Saint Laurent’s bedazzled rain boots from the 2015 runway come to mind. In 2019, a bubblegum pink pair of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Balenciaga’s infamous platform Crocs</a> joined the archive at the famous Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But “Ugly” shoes aren’t just a designer whim or a barometer for social change. In today’s street-style-pics-or-it-didn’t-happen fashion cycle, wild soles can also be essential to getting noticed. Fashion can create serious currency in the attention economy, and if the right “Ugly” shoe can get its owner closer to fame, some will see it as a worthy investment — even if it means spending real money for the mere possibility of online likes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The big bang of “Ugly, but make it fashion, but also make it viral!” happened this past February, when MSCHF debuted their Big Red Boots. The headline-loving label also once made Birkenstocks out of Birkin bags, but this particular style transcended the realm of in-joke and became a genuine status accessory.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the spring 2023 runway cycle, the Big Red Boots were on every major street style site and scored features in news outlets like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>The Washington Post,</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>People</a>. Janelle Monae and model Sarah Snyder wore them; their TikTok hashtag currently has more than 324 million views. (The population of America is 331.9 million people, BTW.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In July, the Big Red Boots got a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sequel courtesy of a Crocs collaboration</a>. Bright yellow and featuring the signature Croc heel strap, the boots are basically Spongebob Square Pants in footwear form. Victoria Beckham and Paris Hilton have already been photographed in them, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>this</a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3> meme</a>? Chef’s kiss.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-future-is-flat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Future Is Flat</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The “Ugly” shoe isn’t going anywhere, but it is evolving, and there’s a new crop just on the horizon. One top contender for fashion’s next viral “Ugly” shoe: Vintage-inspired bowling shoes, a TikTok favorite as seen on Gen Z star Elle Fanning, Millennial favorite Amber Tamblyn, and a surprising amount of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Pinterest posts</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Influencer Clara Perlmutter (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@tinyjewishgirl</a>) is betting that her 1 million followers will love the “dream pair” of vintage Prada bowling shoes from 2001 that she just found on eBay. “I’ve been working on my ability to slay in a casual way,” she notes, explaining that the bowling shoes, along with “geriatric trainers that look like what my grandparents wear for comfort,” pair well with leather pants, long skirts, and jeans. There’s also the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Onitsuka Tiger</a>, which has the same geometric seams as a bowling shoe but with a more elevated, streamlined shape. Kaia Gerber and Kristen Stewart are wearing them on coffee runs, and editors like HighSnobiety’s Willa Bennet are styling them with satin ribbons subbed for normal shoelaces, adding a super cute edge to the "Ugly" shoe.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Sandy Liang MJ Mesh.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hannah Rosa Lewis-Lopes</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Martine Rose x Nike</a> mules are also in the running as the next big (weird) fashion thing of 2023, which is good since you can actually run in them. Thanks to Rose’s must-have status among hypebeasts and fashion insiders, the sneakers made early celebrity appearances on the feet of Kendrick Lamar and Hailey Bieber. In a recent street style shoot, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Little Book of New York Style</a> author Kristen Bateman paired them with a neon green Selkie dress and tweed Chanel purse. “I normally hate sneakers,” she said. “But the square toe and corkscrew sole are just so unique. They really sold me... I did think they’d feel kind of ‘bouncy’ because of the sole, and they don’t! But they’re easy and look hard.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fashion fans are also leaning into a recent collection of misshapen ballet flats, with a pointier silhouette and see-through materials that expose the toes. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Bottega Veneta</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>The Row</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Sandy Liang</a> were early adopters; now, even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Zara</a> sells a pair. “When the mesh ballet flats from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel=nofollow>Khaite</a> came back in stock, our readers flipped,” says Jessica Graves, the creative director and editor who helms <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel=nofollow>The Love List</a>, a shopping newsletter for luxury fashion. Graves cites <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=7 rel=nofollow>Alaïa’s version</a> of the fishnet flat as another e-comm driver. Why the popularity? “It’s different; it’s weird… and it has a Venetian slipper vibe that really appeals to people who love Renaissance art or maybe studied art history in college. The shape is strange to the eye, but if you have that reference point, you can place it. So it feels very in-the-know.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Yume Yume Love Mule.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hannah Rosa Lewis-Lopes</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve been following the InStyle <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram account</a>, you know our editors have been puddle-jumping from one runway show to the next, thanks to a series of relentless thunderstorms that turned New York City into a very chic swamp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Between global warming and economic jitters, it’s no longer just Manhattanites who want to walk everywhere — and therefore need a pair of shoes that can endure the daily wear of taking public transit. Real talk? You can’t run for the last train home in a pair of 4-inch stilettos unless you’re ready to fall flat on your face. (Yep, I’ve done this. No, I don’t recommend it, even for the new Valentino pumps.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eco-activist and designer Erin Beatty of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Rentrayage</a> just sent her version of the "Ugly" shoe down the runway: a subversive take on a kitten heel with actual cat ears creeping up the front. Her mindset? “When I think of what I want to wear to the apocalypse, I want to be comfortable. But I also want to be, you know, cool. Like, ‘Hey, we’re here! We’re surviving! We make it look pretty good!’” See you there in my Martine Rose x Nike mules.<br></p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Credits</h3><ul><li><strong>Photographer</strong></li><li>Hannah Rosa Lewis-Lopes</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Photo Assistant</strong></li><li>Katy Andrascik</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571KCjsmWjnbymv4ytqZ6mlGKEeoKTaWtt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
