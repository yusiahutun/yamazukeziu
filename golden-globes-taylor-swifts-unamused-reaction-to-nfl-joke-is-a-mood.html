The singer recently attended the 81st Golden Globes ceremony and became a punchline when host Jo Koy tried to deliver an NFL joke, comparing the huge screen time she gets every time she attends a match. While some members of the audience laughed, Tay Tay seemed unimpressed.</strong></p><p>The Golden Globes 2024 ceremony lived up to its hype and supplied several viral moments ripe for <a href=#>TikTok</a>. From <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> and Selena Gomez discussing hot piping tea with best friend Keleigh Sperry, to Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet engrossed in their world of PDA, fans could not stop gushing over the latest show’s biggest clips.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1916486595-714x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-unbothered-reaction-at-the-golden-globes-hits-hard>Taylor Swift’s unbothered reaction at the Golden Globes hits hard</h2><p>The <a href=#>Miss Americana and Heartbreak Princess</a> crooner has a song lyric for every occasion and, in this case, the perfect lyric would be ‘jokes weren’t funny.’ The 34-year-old <a href=#>celebrity</a> attended the Golden Globes award as a nominee in the new cinematic and box office achievement category, for her widely successful Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour concert film.</p><p>Host Jo Koy took a shot at Taylor in his opening monologue, comparing the recent popularity of the <a href=#>music</a> legend at <a href=#>NFL games</a> and the Golden Globes. “The big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? At the Golden Globes, we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift,” the comedian quipped.</p><p>The camera swiftly panned to Tay Tay but she seemed unamused at the dig. The Karma crooner took a sip of her drink while having no hint of laughter in her facial expression. ‘Such a mood,’ a fan said on X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>).</p><p>Another fan commented: “She is so real, expressing how we’re all feeling with just one look.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-besties-discussing-tea>Besties ‘discussing’ tea</h2><p>Put two best friends in a room and they will end up discussing the ‘tea’ of the day, even if it is Taylor Swift and <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a>, and the ‘room’ is the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles.</p><p>Fans are loving a viral clip of Selena and T. Swizzle, where the two seemed invested in discussing an event with their close friend Keleigh Sperry. While only professional lip readers would be able to tell what they were talking about, fans are ready to take guesses and a popular one has something to do with a certain Timothee who was also present in the audience.</p><p>A fan posted:</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WFcLPOpZuepl2cubCuxKxkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2Bso2LCr63MrqqenF2nsqKv06Kmp2WkpHqvsstmoaijlWK2tHnAZqSop5Rk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
