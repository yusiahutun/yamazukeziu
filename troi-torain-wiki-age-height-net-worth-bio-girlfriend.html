So, the DJ like <strong>Troi Torain</strong> has to get into the industry for a change.</p><p>Troi was a jock with a radio show Star: Live and Direct.&nbsp; An African While he may not have been on our radar before, he certainly is as for now. According to the star, he and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Jay Z</strong> </a>are “age mates,” which would mean the rapper is actually 50’s — not 40’s, as public records indicate.</p><h2>Early Life of Troi Torain</h2><p>Troi Torain was born on&nbsp;<span class=hidden-sm>May</span>&nbsp;3,&nbsp;1964, in&nbsp;Scotch Plains,&nbsp;New Jersey. The star hasn’t revealed much about himself to the world which includes the details about his parents and siblings. He also hasn’t said a word about his early life and educational qualifications.</p><p>Since he is a popular DJ he must be a graduate student. Yet we cannot really confirm the report.&nbsp;The star belongs to Afro-American ethnicity and holds American&nbsp;nationality.</p><h2>Body Measurement</h2><p>Age of 54 and soon to be 55 Troi was pretty successful in his career. Keeping his age in mind, he is pretty lean and thin. As the star hasn’t revealed any details about his body measurement, height, and weight we cannot really talk about it. However, looking at his very few pictures available on the internet, he seems pretty tall with black hair and eyes.</p><p><strong>See More: <a class="LinkSuggestion__Link-sc-1mdih4x-2 jZPuuT" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal>Shane Paul McGhie</a></strong></p><h2>Relationship status</h2><p>The star is not available in any sort of social media platform. He hasn’t made any new regarding his love affair yet. Neither has he ever talked about his love life out in public with media.</p><p>As the star is already 54 years old he might be married and already have children. The star is not really popular, the news about him is very less on the internet. There is also no picture evidence&nbsp;about his family.</p><p><strong>See More: <a class="LinkSuggestion__Link-sc-1mdih4x-2 jZPuuT" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal>Kodi Lee Bio, Wiki, Age, Parents, AGT, Golden Buzzer</a></strong></p><h2>Bits of Gossips & Controversies</h2><p>When you are in constant limelight you are sure to get dragged in gossips and controversies. So, Troi is no new to these sort of scandals. During 2006, the star was arrested. As he threatened to attack a rival DJ’s family. Furthermore, he was fired from his morning slot at Power 105.1.</p><p>According to the source, a lot of people&nbsp;dislike him. They believe he pursues fame by pushing the boundaries of decency. The radio personality is in serious trouble as he crossed the line of legality with his offensive comments about the 4-year-old daughter of Hot 97’s DJ Envy. Talking about his current career status he is out of the spotlight and living a low-key life.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>Since he is living a very low key life we are not sure how much his net worth is as for now. He might have earned $thousands of dollar from his DJ career. Similarly, no one knows about his currents monetary status. Hopefully, he is living an easy-going life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHAta3Rm6CoZpOkunDA0aigZqyfp66quoywoKShXZa0pnnHnqCgoKRiu6bAjLCmq6yYYq%2Bqu4ygoKuklqe2prrDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
