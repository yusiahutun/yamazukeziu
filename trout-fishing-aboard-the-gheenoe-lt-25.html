As the years rolled on and freshwater discharges into the river system created a major shift in available grassy habitat, sea trout numbers declined and the good fortune necessary to tangle with the rare “gator” trout became increasingly difficult to find.</p><p class=p3>Turning his sole focus away from the declining lagoon fishery, Zyak expanded his range to include fishing along Stuart’s ocean beaches. But the pull of the early morning thump of a large trout under glassy waters never drifted too far from his thoughts. <span class=s2>The combination of some old-school clientele requesting flat-water trips and his own desire to return to his roots led Zyak to pursue a build project that would result in the perfect low-impact boat </span>for chasing the elusive trophy trout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/His-new-skiff-is-perfect-for-flat-water-fishing.-Photo-by-George-LaBonte-1024x683.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s3>Few skinny-water boats have the cult following a <a href=# rel=noopener>Gheenoe</a> custom build has. Zyak, the for</span><span class=s4>mer owner of several Gheenoe boats, has experience with the novelty of building one of these unique watercraft to spec. When it came time to spec out a new boat for a return to the flats where he originally made his mark in the industry, the Custom Gheenoe Lo Tide 25 was a logical start.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p3>A visit to the Gheenoe website offers a base price for the hull followed by an à la carte list of options. Beginning with the bare hull, Zyak added an array of accessories that would make some larger flats skiffs blush. A 25-HP outboard for power was first, along with a Minn Kota Ulterra 80-pound thrust trolling motor. A Minn Kota 8-foot Raptor stake anchor is perfect for a quick stop and cast without making a ruckus. A tall, stand-up center console with tilt steering accommodates a Humminbird Solix 10 GPS sounder unit.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/Sea-trout-catch-of-the-day.-Photo-by-George-LaBonte-1024x834.jpg><p class=p3>The poling platform provides an elevated seat for spotting spooky trout, and a forward raised casting deck was built for elevating the angler’s perspective while housing both a dry stor<span class=s3>age compartment and a separate live bait well. The entire interior</span> is trimmed in SeaDek, along with accents on the console dash <span class=s3>and poling platform. Forward </span>against the console, an Engel cooler serves as both a drink box and a seat. A padded backrest is mounted against the console face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/02/The-boat-is-powered-by-a-25-HP-Tohatsu-he-also-added-a-Minn-Kota-Ulterra-trolling-motor.-Photo-by-George-LaBonte-300x210.jpg><p class=p3>While putting some break-in hours on his new engine, Zyak took a few minutes to sneak into the skinniest of waters looking for any sign of his old friends. A few <span class=s3>casts produced that familiar</span> thump—and a flash of optimism washed over the glassy surface.</p><h3 class=p1>Power File</h3><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Length:</b></span> 16 feet</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Beam:</b></span> 56 inches</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Draft:</b></span> 5 inches</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Weight:</b></span> 270 pounds</p><p class=p2><span class=s1><b>Fuel: </b></span>6.5 gallons (remote)</p><p class=p3><b>Max HP:</b><span class=s2> 25</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycLvUrZuop6KofLW%2Bzq6rZp6ZqLWqusZmmJunkaexbsDHnmSgoJWau7CxjKWrZmplZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
