But her fame-filled journey started when she played the role of a troubled teen mother in the Danish film Daisy Diamond. She portrayed the character with such beauty that she won the Bodil Award and the Robert Award,&nbsp;the two top film awards in Denmark.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>As her popularity grew, she was able to earn a lead role in the movie called The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which was a critical and commercial success.
