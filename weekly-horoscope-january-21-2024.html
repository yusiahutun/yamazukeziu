Aquarius season is well underway, so stay tuned for what comes next.</p><p>On January 23, you’ll brace for a stabilizing shift as <a href=#>Venus—</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planet</a><a href=#> of love and money</a>—enters grounded and goal-oriented Capricorn. This will charge your desire to forge a solid relationship based on shared values, and if you’re dating, this is a beautiful transit for sealing the deal and making it official.</p><p>A rush of gorgeous energy will surround you by January 25, as <a href=#>full </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon</a><a href=#> in Leo</a> will sprinkle fairy dust all over your heart once it takes place at 12:53 p.m. ET. This full moon will square off <a href=#>with </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Jupiter</a><a href=#> in Taurus</a>—which is also forming a trine with Venus in Capricorn—emphasizing the desire to indulge in the pleasures of life, tap into your ability to make money, and your willingness to dive into romance. Once <a href=#>the Aquarius </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sun</a> squares off with Jupiter on January 27, you may feel larger than life, but make sure your confidence can lead to something practical.</p><p>You’re embracing another shift <a href=#>as Uranus</a><a href=#>stations direct</a> on January 27. This could bring a surprising turn of events, especially if you have placements in Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, or Aquarius from 16 to 24 degrees. You may feel compelled to try something different, so follow your stream of consciousness and see where it takes you.</p><p>Passions strike as intellectual Mercury joins forces with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">primal</a><a href=#> Mars in Capricorn</a> on January 27, intensifying every thought and action you take. This could lead to powerful results if you stay focused, but perspectives could clash if there are disagreements. Be mindful of which methods you use to get your point across.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.6568848758465><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zodiacbanner_aries.png><p>This week, you might be pushed into the spotlight.</p><p>On Monday, January 22, the moon in Gemini and your house of communication opposes Venus in Sagittarius.
