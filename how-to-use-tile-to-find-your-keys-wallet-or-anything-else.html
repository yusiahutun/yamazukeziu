If you lose&nbsp;other important things like your keys or wallet, however, you're usually out of luck. The <a href=#>Tile keychain and card gadget trackers</a>&nbsp;aim to solve that by letting you call your valuables&nbsp;from your phone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-tile>What Is Tile?</h2><p>Tile is a&nbsp;Bluetooth-enabled device tracker that pairs with your smartphone. It comes in two forms. The <a href=#>Tile Mate</a>&nbsp;($25) is a small, square keychain that's not much bigger than a quarter. It has a hole in one corner so you can attach it to your key ring, purse, or backpack. There's also the <a href=#>Tile Slim</a>&nbsp;($30), which is a thinner square than the Mate, but wider. It's as tall as one credit card, and as thin as two or three. It can fit neatly inside your wallet or notebook without adding extra bulk.</p><p>While each Tile is a little expensive on its own, you can get bundles&nbsp;to save money, like <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">this 4-pack with two Tile Mates and two Tile Slims</a>&nbsp;for $90. On top of that, you can earn points by inviting friends&nbsp;to get free Tiles. If you invite two friends, you can get a free Mate, and four friends earns you a free Slim. Not a bad deal, if you&nbsp;know a lot of forgetful people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can pair your Tile with your phone, allowing you to locate it whenever you're nearby. If you're within Bluetooth range, you can&nbsp;open the app, find&nbsp;the&nbsp;object you're missing, and tap "Find" to&nbsp;make it ring. The Tile will then play a loud ringtone. Then you can follow the sound to discover that you left your keys on the kitchen counter, right in front of you like an idiot.</p><p>When you're not within Bluetooth range, the Tile app can show you the last known location of your keys or wallet on a map.&nbsp;On top of remembering where you were when your phone was last near your&nbsp;valuables, Tile also uses the community of Tile members to find your stuff. So, for example, if you left your&nbsp;wallet at the bar and there are other&nbsp;Tile users nearby,&nbsp;your wallet's location will continually be updated as long as someone else is in range. This is particularly handy if your wallet gets picked up or taken somewhere. Tile's community isn't a guaranteed way to track your stuff, since there aren't a ton of Tile users everywhere, but it's better than&nbsp;relying solely on your own phone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a bonus, Tiles also include a small button inside each keychain or card. When you double-click this button, the Tile will ring your phone, even if it's on silent. So, if you're heading out the door and you have your keys but can't find your phone, you can ring it with a couple clicks. Turns out it was in your back pocket. Of course.</p><h2 id=how-to-set-up-a-new-tile>How to Set Up a New Tile</h2><p>To set up your Tile, you'll need to download and install the Tile app for&nbsp;<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android</a>&nbsp;or <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iOS</a>. When you first open the app, you'll need to create an account, if you don't already have one, and log in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile1-324.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile2-324.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You'll need to make sure that&nbsp;Tile can access your phone's Bluetooth and your GPS location. If you've turned off either, the next page will ask you to turn them&nbsp;on.&nbsp;You'll also need to keep in mind that&nbsp;Bluetooth and GPS are necessary to locate and track your Tiles. If you ever need to turn them off to save battery,&nbsp;you won't be able to ring your Tiles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile3-324.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile5-324.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Your phone will be added as the first Tile device&nbsp;on your account.&nbsp;Even without a Tile Mate or Slim, you can use <a href=#>the app on the web</a>&nbsp;to find your phone. Click "Got it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile6-324.png><p>Tap the plus symbol at the top of the screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile7-324.png><p>If you haven't confirmed your email address, you'll need to do so before you can add any Tiles. You'll receive a six-digit code to the email address on your account. Enter it&nbsp;to continue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile8-324-1.png><p>Next, choose the model of Tile you have to add it to your account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile9-324.png><p>For the next step, grab your Tile and click the button in the center underneath the logo. Put your Tile next to your phone to pair it. The app&nbsp;will also demonstrate on your screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile10-324.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile11-324.png><p>Once your Tile is paired, you should see a bright blue screen saying that your Tile has been activated.</p><p>NOTE: after this point, you won't be able to add your Tile to another&nbsp;account <a href=#>without&nbsp;contacting Tile</a>. For security reasons, Tile only allows you to hide a Tile from&nbsp;the app or transfer it to someone else's account (which you have to email support to do). If you want to delete&nbsp;your Tile entirely, you'll need to contact Tile support and the Tile won't be able to be used again. This is to help ensure that&nbsp;a thief can't easily remove&nbsp;Tiles from your account in case your stuff gets stolen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile12-324.png><p>Next, you can pick&nbsp;what you're going to use your Tile on. You can choose from some preset categories like keys or wallet, or choose your own custom label. Tiles still work the same way no matter what you choose, but this helps you easily spot the&nbsp;thing you're looking for from a list.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile13-324.png><p>On the last screen, you can test your Tile by tapping the green Find button. This will make your Tile ring until you click the logo on it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile14-324.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile15-324.png><p>You can repeat this process for as&nbsp;all the Tiles you need.</p><h2 id=how-to-find-your-stuff-with-your-tile>How to Find Your Stuff With Your Tile</h2><p>There are two ways you can use your Tile to find your stuff. You can either use your phone to locate your Tile, or you can use your Tile to locate your phone. For the former, open up your app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here, you'll see a list of all the Tile objects (including your phone). The icon on the right will show you the connection status of your Tile. A solid green line will indicate that your phone is connected to the Tile. A dotted green line indicates that your Tile is nearby but hasn't connected yet.&nbsp;This can help you find your Tile when it's in the house, but you're not sure what room it's in. Walk from room to room until the line turns solid.&nbsp;A grey line indicates that your Tile is not nearby.&nbsp;If that's the case,&nbsp;use the map feature to find where your Tile was last seen. Tap the Tile you want to find to continue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile16-324.png><p>On the individual Tile screen, you can see your options&nbsp;for finding your stuff. If you're within range, tap the green Find button to ring your Tile. If you need to see a map of where your stuff is, tap Options then choose "View on Map."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile17-324.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile18-324.png><p>The "View on Map" button will show you where your Tile was last seen on a map. You can pan around and zoom to see where it is. If another Tile user finds your device, the location should&nbsp;update. It's not a guarantee, but you may get lucky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile19-324.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can also use your Tile to find your phone. Double-click the button inside the logo and your phone should start ringing, even if it's on silent. When you find your phone, you'll see a notification for the alert. Tap Found It to turn off the&nbsp;ringing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tile20-324.png><p>Ideally, once you set up your Tile, you'll forget about it most of the time. Tile isn't a perfect way to find your stuff if you ever lose it outside your home, but it&nbsp;can help you realize when you&nbsp;forgot something at the bar or find your keys in the couch cushions. It's a little piece of mind that can help you out when you need it most.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhqaWhlZoRwtM6wZK2nXarApnnToqOeZaSkeqe1zZ1ksqelp3qssdisZLCZnKGytXnOq2Sapqmptaq6xmacpauVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
