So it went back. We’re having another bus built right now.”</p><p><strong>Brantley Already Knows What Kind of Dad He'll Be</strong></p><p>Gilbert’s baby — his first child —&nbsp;will arrive in November, so “<a href=#>The Weekend</a>” singer has some time to get it right. He’s also looked for help from fellow&nbsp;country star <a href=#>Eric Church</a> and his wife Katherine, who consistently travel with their young’ns.</p><p>“We talked to Eric and his wife about kind of the set up on their bus and stuff,” Gilbert says. “’Cause down the road we want to make sure that what we’re building right now, that we can convert it to take care of that cause I told [Amber], ‘They’re gonna be with me.’”</p><p>Church has traveled with wife and sons, Boone and Hawkins, virtually since the day each was born and has even referenced his backstage area to a play area. Gilbert appears to be next in line. His latest single, “The Ones That&nbsp;Like Me” from his latest album The Devil Don’t Sleep, is set for a summer impact.</p><p><strong>The Cutest Baby Bumps in Country Music</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6qRo8GtsdhmnqKkkpq%2FtXnBmpmyZZOqwLW7zGarqK2iYq%2B2v44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
