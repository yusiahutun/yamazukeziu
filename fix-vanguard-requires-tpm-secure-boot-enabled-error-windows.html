However, before looking into how to enable these features, ensure that your operating system supports both TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot.</p><h2 id=check-if-your-device-supports-tpm-2-0-and-secure-boot>Check if Your Device Supports TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot</h2><p>If you have legitimately upgraded to Windows 11 and haven't bypassed the TPM requirement, your device likely already supports these features.

Check out our <a href=#>guide on how to check your TPM version</a> to find out which version your PC uses. If your device does not have TPM, or it runs an older version than 2.0, you will need to upgrade your system.</p><p>However, if your system supports these features but either one is currently disabled, you can enable them to get back into the game.</p><h2 id=how-to-enable-tpm-and-secure-boot-on-windows>How to Enable TPM and Secure Boot on Windows</h2><p>You can enable TPM and Secure Boot from the BIOS/UEFI settings menu. There are several ways to access these settings. In our guide on <a href=#>how to enable TPM and Secure Boot</a>, we have covered a general method to enter your BIOS settings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you enter the BIOS/UEFI settings menu, find the TPM and Secure Boot settings. Unfortunately, the exact location of these settings will vary between manufacturers. As such, it's a good idea to double-check your computer or motherboard manufacturer's documentation for instructions.</p><p>For example, you can check out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Dell Support</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo Support</a> for advice on enabling Secure Boot on those devices. If you're having an issue enabling TPM, there is advice on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ASUS Support</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Dell Support</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HP Customer Support</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo Support</a> if you're using any of those manufacturer's products. Hopefully, enabling these settings will resolve the issue.</p><p>TPM might be listed under a different name on some motherboards. For example, it is PTT (Platform Trust Technology) for Intel processors and AMD fTPM for AMD processors. Likewise, enabling Secure Boot sometimes stop users from dual-booting numerous Linux distributions. So, if you want to run those, disable this feature first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-should-you-do-if-secure-boot-isn-rsquo-t-supported-or-tpm-isn-rsquo-t-installed>What Should You Do if Secure Boot Isn’t Supported or TPM Isn’t Installed?</h2><p>If Secure Boot isn't supported or TPM isn't installed on your device, you aren't successful in working around these limitations, and you don't want to upgrade your PC, you're left with only one option; revert to Windows 10.</p><p>The Windows 11 version of Vanguard asks for TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot because Windows 11 PCs have these enabled by default; it's part of the system requirements.
