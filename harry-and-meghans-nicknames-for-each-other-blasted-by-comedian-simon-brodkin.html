The pet names can be heard throughout their documentary, Harry & Meghan, which <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry released in late 2022. It gave viewers another intimate look inside their life after leaving The Firm. However, it doesn’t seem the <a href=#>celebrity</a> funnyman was best pleased with what he witnessed.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1052479240-1024x729.jpg><p>Brodkin tells his audience he watched the <a href=#>Netflix</a> docuseries and “really wanted to like them,” but their use of the nicknames H and M for each other was overzealous for him.</p><p>“They were making interesting points about racism and misogyny, but then they started calling each other H and M and I just thought, ‘Oh do f*** off.'”</p><p>He continued: “Honestly, by the time Harry was describing a particular date with Meghan as the night they, quote, ‘pulled the pin on a fun grenade,’ I actually started rooting for Prince Andrew.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle’s feud ‘affected Harry’s relationship’</a></p><p>Prince Andrew is no longer a working member of the royal family after stepping down in 2019 and losing his royal title – His <a href=#>Royal</a> Highness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-famous-halloween-party>The famous Halloween party</h2><p>The party Brodkin was referencing was discussed in both the six-part docuseries in which Prince Harry and Meghan Markle call each other their nicknames and the duke’s book Spare.</p><p>Talking about the party, which happened the night before they went public in 2016, Harry explained: “We went to this Halloween party together where we could be completely dressed up and no one would know. I had a bandana and goggles.”</p><p>“You borrowed a great costume. And we were like ‘well this might be our last shot to just go out and have fun out in the world,'” Meghan responded before Harry added: “Pull the pin on the fun grenade, which we did.”</p><p>In his explosive memoir, the 39-year-old described his costume, wearing the actual one Tom Hardy used in the 2015 <a href=#>movie</a> Mad Max. “For help with my costume. I’d turned to a friend, the actor Tom Hardy, before I left home. I’d phoned him to ask if I could borrow his costume from Mad Max.</p><p>“‘The whole thing?’ ‘Yes, please, mate! The whole kit.’ He’d given it all to me before I left Britain, and now I tried it on in Meg’s little bathroom. When I came out, she roared with laughter.</p><p>“It was funny. And a little scary. But the main thing was I was unrecognizable.”</p><p>He described partying afterward with his now former <a href=#>TV</a> star wife, cousin Princess Eugenie and her husband. The dad-of-two said it was “loud, dark, drunk—ideal.” He was not recognized, he wrote, though people “did double takes” at Meghan.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may ‘split for good’ as psychic issues gloomy warning</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WAcLTAq6myZZGjsW65xKCfmqajYruqr8qnmKado2KzsL6MnpicoF2kwamx0WaZpZmjqbKlecGyZJynnZqxqq3NZqqipZ%2BjeqO%2Bzp2ioqZf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
