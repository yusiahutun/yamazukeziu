After getting a <a href=#>breast and butt reduction</a>, Chyna revealed that she was also <a href=#>removing facial fillers</a> in her jawline, cheeks and lips. She took to Instagram to share videos from two sessions, explaining that her decision was made after she began to live a healthier lifestyle. Due to her naturally high cheekbones and defined jawline, when her original facial structure began to come through more, it made the fillers "look crazy."</p><p>"This is my actual jaw, I already have the structure. I don't even know why I did fillers. Well, I did them because everybody was doing it. So let this be a lesson, don't even do it all, it's not even worth it," she shared. "I did it when I was so young, I didn't even give my body time to really develop. Just trust me, it's gonna come. You're gonna get the snatched face that you need and that you want as you get older, and then as you get older you'll say, I miss my baby face."</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a></p><p>Courteney Cox says she first decided to get fillers and injections at the advice of several doctors. As time went on, Courteney got more work done and admits she eventually didn’t even look like herself. A friend finally told her it was time to stop and she’s since gotten her facial fillers removed.</p><p>"What would end up happening is that you go to a doctor who would say, 'You look great, but what would help is a little injection here or filler there.' So you walk out and you don’t look so bad and you think, no one noticed—it's good. Then somebody tells you about another doctor: 'This person's amazing. They do this person who looks so natural.' You meet them and they say, 'You should just do this.' The next thing you know, you're layered and layered and layered. You have no idea because it's gradual until you go, 'Oh s--t, this doesn't look right,'" Courteney told <a href=#>NewBeauty</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a829d1e9-ef45-4865-ad47-be1b5574c13e data-container-ref=toofab:article:70ed0ea4-ba8a-4290-bb95-029d21980f8c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/41/5by4/2023/03/10/41d880151bd34abcb07dff4751145520_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Courteney Cox's Biggest Beauty Regret Is Getting Facial Fillers</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a></p><p>Back in 2016, Khloé Kardashian revealed that she had gotten facial fillers -- and ended up having a really negative reaction. She decided to get all of it dissolved and, at the time, she said she was scared to do anything to her face ever again.</p><p>"I don't know if it's Botox or filler, [but] I did one of them and my whole face went numb and I could not make [an expression]. I had to dissolve everything...I looked crazy and I still think the effects are like, in there...And my face was so f--ked, I had to go and get this whole thing, like, dissolved. It was a bummer because now I'm afraid to do it again, but I swear, I think things are still in my face," Khloé said during an episode of “<a href=#>Kocktails With Khloé</a>.”</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a></p><p>Khloé’s younger sister Kylie Jenner has also had a long journey with facial fillers. After denying her use of lip filler for quite a while, Kylie finally revealed in 2015 that she was getting temporary filler. Then in 2018, fans noticed Kylie was looking more natural and she revealed that she had made the decision <a href=#>to get them completely dissolved</a>. Although she didn’t share the reason behind the change, it ultimately wasn’t long until she decided to get filler again.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8fb2385b-8acf-4081-8167-8732cefc7665 data-container-ref=toofab:article:70ed0ea4-ba8a-4290-bb95-029d21980f8c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0d/5by4/2023/02/22/0dc2fb0360c04321b49ef31a7f12556b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Luigi & Iango for Vanity Fair Italia</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kylie Jenner Reveals Favorite Sister and Who's Her Total Opposite</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Melanie Griffith</strong></a></p><p>Melanie Griffith says she didn't realize how drastically fillers had changed her appearance until people started talking about it in the media. She ultimately decided to go to another doctor and over the course of several years, they worked on dissolving what had been injected into her face.</p><p>"About seven years ago I started doing injections, and now for the past two, three years, I have been getting it dissolved - it takes a while. I didn't see it until people started saying, 'Oh my God, what has she done?' I was so hurt I went to a different doctor and he started dissolving all of this s--t that this other woman doctor put in," Melanie told <a href=#>Porter magazine</a>. “I had done to my lips too. So awful. Hopefully, I look more normal now."</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Simon Cowell</strong></a></p><p>After Simon Cowell began getting facial filler and Botox, he admits there came a point when he felt "like something out of a horror film." When he realized his son Eric was scared of his appearance, he knew it was time to change things.</p><p>"There was a stage where I might have gone a bit too far. I saw a picture of me from 'before' the other day, and didn't recognise it as me first of all. Eric was in hysterics. Enough was enough. There is no filler in my face at all now. Zero," Simon told <a href=#>The Sun</a>. "There was a phase where everyone was having their faces pumped full of this and the other. But actually, for me now, a lot of it comes down to healthy eating and drinking tons of water."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:792e1c9e-d475-41ca-a6bb-e10489f3c86c data-container-ref=toofab:article:70ed0ea4-ba8a-4290-bb95-029d21980f8c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/81/5by4/2022/08/01/81b78046cc824afda0ff0fc5de1c72b3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Yolanda Hadid Opens Up About Depression and Lyme Disease Relapse</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>Yolanda Hadid</strong></a></p><p>While Yolanda Hadid was struggling with Lyme disease, she discovered that her breast implants were leaking silicone into her body.

"Thank God you can dissolve them I looked like #malificent."</p><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Jessica Simpson</strong></a></p><p>Early in her career Jessica Simpson decided that lip filler wasn’t for her. Back in 2006, she explained that she had previously gotten filler but disliked it so much that she let it fade away.</p><p>"I had that Restylane stuff. But it fades -- it went away in like four months. My lips are back to what they were. Thank God! It looked fake to me. I didn't like that," Jessica told <a href=#>Glamour</a>.</p><a id=gallery-link-9f5fcac7-e832-4456-bca7-e0e414434d6b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9f5fcac7-e832-4456-bca7-e0e414434d6b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:70ed0ea4-ba8a-4290-bb95-029d21980f8c data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/94/4by3/2023/03/22/94f33c7e77134993bbf2338ab2eb1343_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2xma25fmLKtscGsZKyZmZl6qLvOnZmynV2pvG6yyKWjnqqjYq%2BwwM6xZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
