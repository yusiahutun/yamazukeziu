And yet whenever I try to describe it to the uninitiated, I struggle to find the words. Even those of us who are familiar tend to talk about Kiko Kostadinov exclusively in fangirl sign language—hands to chest, the impression of a deep sigh, clenched fists with a giddy grin. It all roughly translates to, “It’s just so good.”</p><img alt="a person in a black jacket and boots" title="a person in a black jacket and boots" width=1210 height=1626 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2024-03-06-at-2-57-46-pm-65e8cac656f94.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Kiko Kostadinov</span><p>A typical Kiko Kostadinov look: colors and textures and patterns and prints you’d never think to wear together, styled with a kind of shoe you feel like you’ve never seen before.</p><p>Kiko Kostadinov started as a menswear brand bearing the name of its designer, who launched it with an attention-grabbing Central Saint Martins’ MA graduate show in 2016. Since then, he's worked with streetwear brand Stüssy and sneaker brand Asics on collaborations that sold out instantly. Kostadinov's clothing has hype because it is both tactical and transcendent; it is grounded in practicality while also somehow existing in its own colorful and warped plane of reality. The Fanning sisters have brought that same hype to the womenswear iteration, which launched in 2018.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During Paris Fashion Week, I asked the Fanning sisters what makes their clothing so special. They responded by telling me about the 2014 documentary Advanced Style, which chronicled the lives of seven older, eccentric, and exceptionally well-dressed New Yorkers, like the late <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a60054459/iris-apfel-dies-age-102/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Iris Apfel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Iris Apfel</a>.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Our industry is so youth-focused, and all of the advertising campaigns basically show you people who are under 25,” Laura said. “But sometimes it takes a lifetime to accumulate that wealth of ease, and the ability to dress and style yourself and put textures and colors together. Looking at the women [of Advanced Style], they probably are at a point where they don't have to please anyone—they're truly just pleasing themselves and having joy in what they wear.”</p><img alt="a woman wearing a black coat" title="a woman wearing a black coat" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kiko-kostadinov-f24-011-1-65e8cbe73a59b.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Kiko Kostadinov</span><p>A look from the brand’s most recent Fall 2024 show in Paris.</p><p>The Fanning sisters' Kiko Kostadinov feels exactly like that wealth of ease. Their funnily-shaped bags hang from carabiner clips on neon belts slung on billowing Bermuda shorts. Their red snakeskin hybrid ballet flat/sneakers lace up with chunky ribbons. Their striped knits feel trippy, like the color bars of a broken television screen, until you realize your eye is being tricked by intentionally warped ruching, cut-outs, and unexpected asymmetrical foldings. They make clothing that’s nutty and delightful without feeling intimidating. They don’t try hard—they just go hard.</p><img alt="a person walking on a runway" title="a person walking on a runway" width=1074 height=1618 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2024-03-06-at-3-05-13-pm-65e8cc8be61b2.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kiko Kostadinov</span><p>A colorful and layered look from the Spring 2024 show last September in Paris.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But it also doesn’t feel like the kind of clothing one would associate with maturity. It's very much in line with the individualized way young people want to dress. (Case in point: they recently collaborated with Gen Z favorite Heaven). The Advanced Style of it all comes from the way the clothing speaks for itself. When you’re young and still searching for your personal style, that uncertainty can telegraph itself through a level of try-hardness. Kostadinov’s clothing comes with the ease built in.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Deanna thinks that has to do with their very specific approach to glamor. "We’re very drawn to things that feel powerful, things that feel glamorous. There’s the power of women and the power of how they present themselves. They have a mystique.” She sees lots of people these days trying to claim ownership over that, and as women designing for women, she hopes she and her sister can help give some of that power back through the clothing they make.</p><img alt="a person in a garment" title="a person in a garment" width=1214 height=1632 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2024-03-06-at-3-06-08-pm-65e8cce082daa.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Kiko Kostadinov</span><p>A look featuring a skirt from the brand’s recent collaboration with Marc Jacob’s Heaven, a brand beloved by Gen Z for its free spirted grunginess.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Laura, the sisters are always asking themselves, “How do you embody that feminine power, but in a way that you can wear it on a daily basis? How do you keep the essence of something you’d reserve for a special occasion, but make it work for everyday?” To her, dressing that strikes that specific balance is “the joy of living!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And they use the word “joy” again to describe their accessory-making process, specifically the creation of the hybrid shoes they have become known for. You can always recognize a Kiko shoe because it looks like a mish-mash of extremes across the style spectrum—like dainty ballet flats and dad sneakers, or go-go boots and lace-up boxing shoes.</p><img alt="a person wearing boots" title="a person wearing boots" width=1206 height=1630 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2024-03-06-at-3-08-23-pm-65e8cd4203926.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Kiko Kostadinov</span><p>The brand’s popular (and currently extremely sold out) Ribbon boot, with tonal buckling meant to look like strappy flowers, inspired by the lacing of a typically more sporty boxing boot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We develop things for the joy of developing them!” Deanna said. “We're actually not trained in bags and shoes. I think the execution there can be difficult because of that, but I think it can be quite liberating in terms of idea generation. You really don't feel like 'Oh, I wouldn't do it like that!'” Because their training is in ready-to-wear, they often don’t know what isn’t possible right off the bat for shoes or bags, which is exactly why their accessories look like they’ve landed here from a different, more exciting, planet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As expected, at the most recent womenswear show, the Fanning sisters' show notes discussed the idea of dichotomies. The last line read: “A variety of desires play out; intact or wounded, tender or aggressive serving as distinct markers of vulnerability within us.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But perhaps the most present dichotomy is the one they seem to address every season, between the need for ease and the need for mysticism. At Kiko Kostadinov, you can have both. Their woman is an otherworldly being who was born with the wealth of ease often bestowed only on those who have lived through the trials and tribulations of a terrestrial life.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">All the Looks from Kiko Kostadinov Fall 2024</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="kiko kostadinov ready to wear fall winter 2024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kiko-kostadinov-f24-001-65e7438b5dac3.jpg title="kiko kostadinov ready to wear fall winter 2024" width=1667 height=2500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
