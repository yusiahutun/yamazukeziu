The grief submerged me in tidal waves of pain. For a few hours I found it hard to breathe," she further wrote, adding: "Sobriety was not some mystery I had to solve. It was simply looking at all my wounds and learning how to live with them."</p><p id=eDP_sPWnw2 data-wc=33>If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text "STRENGTH" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>988lifeline.org</a>.</p><p id=eRaJA2pnota3 data-wc=23><strong>Read more HELLO!
