Arrest and whereabouts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Although she entered the movie industry in 2009, getting the recognition she enjoys today took her some time. Her debut in the spotlight and rise in popularity happened after she took part in Korean television series like <i>The Inspiring Generation</i>, released in 2014. Her role in the TV series <i>New Tales of Gisaeng</i> (2011) catapulted her career.</p><p class=align-left>After the two series and their rise in popularity, Im Soo-hyang appeared in other excellent productions like <i>My ID is Gangnam Beauty </i>(2018) and the smash-hit mystery thriller <i>Graceful <a href=#>Family</a> </i>(2019).

And since she hails from South Korea (widely considered the world's plastic surgery capital), many people have assumed that she has undergone plastic surgery.</p><p class=align-left>Her popularity has also added more speculation about enhancing her look. Something else even more interesting about the <a href=#>famous actor </a>is that she has acted in a <a href=#>TV series</a> (<i>My ID Gangnam Beauty</i>) where she portrays a 20-year-old college student who decides to get plastic surgery. So, is Im Soo hyang botched?</p><h3>Nose alteration surgery</h3><p class=align-left>Even though it remains speculation considering the actress hasn’t admitted to having undergone the procedure, it is easy to spot the changes. And one of the most noticeable changes in her appearance is that of her nose.</p><p class=align-left>If you look at pictures from her past, you will notice that the tip of her nose was not as pointy as it is now. She used to have a bulbous nose, which is no more. The actress’ nose now appears thinner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3d32566a8a39a8fa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is OMGcosplay?

The best way to find out is to look at photos of Im Soo-hyang before surgery and try to find a difference between her facial features.</p><p class=align-left>She always had beautiful eyelids, and it is hard to tell if she has made any alterations. Her eyelids have likely altered as she grew older and more mature, which is not a result of plastic surgery. She may be applying many facial filters, and it is hard to spot any difference between her looks over time.</p><h3>Lip fillers</h3><p class=align-left>The lips are one of the most altered facial segments for people undergoing plastic surgery. And people have speculated that Im Soo-hyang has done a lip job. It is hard to tell if she has had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lip fillers</a>.</p><p class=align-left>There is no doubt that Im Soo-hyang is a beautiful and talented actress. She has accumulated numerous fans over the years because of her incredible acting prowess. Despite the online community going bonkers about her plastic surgery, she is yet to provide insight.
