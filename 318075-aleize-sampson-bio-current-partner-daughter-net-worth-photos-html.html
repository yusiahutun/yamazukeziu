The influence of their father seems to have played a big role in the kids who are also in the sports world and this is something that Aleize and Ralph despite being divorced are certainly proud of.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6465f1ee961dc71d.jpg><p class=align-left>Aleize Sampson children will hopefully continue building on the exploits of their father who did not just break records but also set some of them. They also have their mother to thank for raising them through a time when the whole world had eyes on them as the divorce shocked the sporting world. The Sampsons are quite a success by any standards and the younger generation is probably just starting out.</p><p class=align-left>Aleize Sampson has been able to stay out of negative publicity especially in a world where superstars and their families drown in negative stories.
