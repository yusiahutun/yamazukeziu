In fact, the style icons to whom we have all looked for centuries aren't even involved in the fashion industry at all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The royals have been popularising certain pieces since time in memoriam, from Princess Alexandra's tailored looks to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/a35115516/the-crown-princess-diana-motherhood/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Diana" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Princess Diana</a>'s pie-crust collars. Then as now, people clamoured to copy the styles they saw on their favourite duchesses and princesses, leading to the formation of trends and the hunt for specific, sought-after pieces. These days, the 'Kate effect' is the nickname given to the economic influence the Princess of Wales wields – which, in recent years, has been estimated to give a £1 billion annual boost to the UK fashion industry. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a43384469/king-charles-coronation/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="At the coronation this weekend" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">At the coronation this weekend</a>, it's fair to say all eyes were on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/g43805427/king-charles-coronation-pictures/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="what Kate wore" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">what Kate wore</a>.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for The best royal gowns in history" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/william-kate-1611226743.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although a brand worn by any member of the royal family can expect an uptick in interest and sales, the royals who really assure a flurry of press and a months-long waiting list are the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/style-files/news/g30338/duchess-of-cambridge-best-style-fashion-moments/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess of Wales" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Princess of Wales</a> and the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a43705584/meghan-pink-short-suit/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Duchess of Sussex" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Duchess of Sussex</a>. "The increase in brand awareness and enquiries was immediate, not just in the UK but especially in the US," says designer Jennifer Chamandi, whose elegant heels have been worn by both royals. Meghan chose a pair of two-tone pumps with the brand's signature strap for a visit to the Robert Clack School in Dagenham in 2020 and Kate soon followed suit, sporting the Lorenzo 105 black suede pumps for a visit to the V&A museum in 2021.</p><img alt="kate wearing jennifer chamandi's 'lorenze 105' pumps to the va in 2021" title="Kate wearing Jennifer Chamandi's 'Lorenze 105' pumps to the V&A in 2021" width=2474 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1232981165-6454f63d57c72.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">JONATHAN BUCKMASTER</span><p>Kate wearing Jennifer Chamandi’s Lorenzo 105 pumps to the V&A in 2021</p><img alt="meghan wearing jennifer chamandi's popular two tone pumps for a visit to a school in 2020" title="Meghan wearing Jennifer Chamandi's popular two-tone pumps for a visit to a school in 2020" width=3712 height=5568 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1205707041-6454f68eb6d26.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">WPA Pool</span><p>Meghan wearing Jennifer Chamandi’s popular two-tone pumps for a visit to a school in 2020</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Chamandi, the 'Kate effect' was instantaneous. "We had messages from stockists globally, wanting to know how quickly we could deliver a shipment of the style Kate wore," she recalls. "Being a British brand, having a member of the royal family wear my shoes was a dream come true. After another intense lockdown, it felt like a ray of optimism."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Predominantly, interest in the brand came from the US, which overtook the UK as the biggest market for orders directly from Chamandi's website. A Newsweek poll earlier this year revealed William and Kate to be the most popular royals stateside, meaning that Kate's outfits have an incredible influence on shoppers across the pond. It's a phenomenon that the shoe designer Camilla Elphick experienced when Kate first wore a pair of her Alicia pumps in 2022, to a charity polo match.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"The phones didn't stop ringing all day"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img alt="windsor, united kingdom july 06 embargoed for publication in uk newspapers until 24 hours after create date and time catherine, duchess of cambridge attends the out sourcing inc royal charity polo cup at guards polo club, flemish farm on july 6, 2022 in windsor, england photo by max mumbyindigogetty images" title="Kate wearing the 'Alicia' Camilla Elphick pumps for a charity polo match in 2022" width=2568 height=4515 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1407226582-6454f6fc29ece.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><p>Kate wearing the Alicia Camilla Elphick pumps for a charity polo match in 2022</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was a normal day in the office, and suddenly I got a flurry of calls from my mum and friends," she explains. "I had no idea [Kate] was going to wear them. The phones didn't stop ringing all day. We've got a live chat on our website, and it just went off the scale – especially in America. At the time, the style was our most popular anyway, but when people saw Kate wearing it, it completely sold out."</p><img alt="windsor, united kingdom july 06 embargoed for publication in uk newspapers until 24 hours after create date and time catherine, duchess of cambridge shoe detail attends the out sourcing inc royal charity polo cup at guards polo club, flemish farm on july 6, 2022 in windsor, england photo by max mumbyindigogetty images" title="Kate Middleton Camilla Elphick shoes" width=3095 height=2068 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1407226534-6454f753bf1a0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><p>The style immediately sold out, and is still one of the brand’s most popular pairs</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The then-duchess went on to wear the shoes again for the Commonwealth Games a few months later, which solidified them as a must-have piece for royal style watchers. "It's now become an iconic style for us," says Elphick. "I think the fact that Kate wore them on two different occasions – once with a dress and once with trousers – showed people how useful they are. We make them in a whole range now, and we have a customer in Dubai who has ever single colour we've ever made."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate's shoes are perhaps the most sure-fire of sell-outs. The first pair she sent viral were from a then-relatively unknown London brand, Penelope Chilvers, whose Long Tassel boots she first wore to a fair in 2004; nearly 1o years later, she still brings them out regularly. In fact, the boots have become so synonymous with Kate that they've been worn on set by Meg Bellamy, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/a33743299/the-crown-season-5-6-cast-plot-air-date/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the actress playing Kate in the upcoming series of " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the actress playing Kate in the upcoming series of </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/a33743299/the-crown-season-5-6-cast-plot-air-date/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Crown" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Crown</a>.</p><img alt="meg bellamy pictured on the set of ﻿the crown﻿, wearing the penelope chilvers boots kate is known to love" title="Meg Bellamy pictured on the set of ﻿The Crown﻿, wearing the Penelope Chilvers boots Kate is known to love" width=2728 height=3632 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pa-71402706-6454f89a96f0f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">PA Images</span><p>Meg Bellamy pictured on the set of The Crown, wearing the Penelope Chilvers boots Kate is known to love</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Kate has been a loyal customer for many years now," says Chilvers. "In fact, she was one of my very first customers, together with her mother and sister. There was a wonderful image of her, perching on a shooting stick, that was used by all the papers to spread the news of her engagement to Prince William."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was an introduction to a beautiful young girl who was to be the future Queen of England, and it was circumstantial that she was wearing our boots," she continues. "But looking back, it was a characterful shot of her, giving away so many of her qualities as a role model: teaching the world to slow down their consumerist habits by wearing her wardrobe more than once, making it very clear that she thinks that 'not new' is OK, and showing her continuous support of British designers."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><img alt="mandatory credit photo by stephen lockshutterstock 725374b kate middleton kate middleton at game fair, blenheim palace, oxfordshire, britain aug 2004 could 2008 be the year that prince william and kate middleton make their relationship official back in august 2004, kate looked like she didnt have a care in the world perhaps safe in the knowledge that she had snagged the worlds number one eligible bachelor the couple met at university of st andrews, scotland, in 2001, when kate was in her first year from around christmas of 2003 to april 2007, she and prince william were involved in a relationship that was subjected to intense media attention but at the game fair at blenheim palace, oxfordshire, kate seemed to be bearing up to the pressure pretty well and has rarely been seen without a smile for the cameras since there have been rumours that the couple have already taken the next major step in their relationship miss middleton has supposedly moved into clarence house, and given the keys to her chelsea flat to her sister, pippa will a ring on the finger be next" title="Kate Middleton wearing Penelope Chilvers at a game fair in 2004 " width=2212 height=3615 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shutterstock-editorial-725374b-6454f8d61489f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Stephen Lock/Shutterstock</span><p>Kate Middleton wearing Penelope Chilvers at a game fair in 2004&nbsp;</p><img alt="darlington, england april 27 catherine, duchess of cambridge during a visit to manor farm in little stainton, durham on april 27, 2021 in darlington, england photo by owen humphreys wpa poolgetty images" title="Kate Middleton Penelope Chilvers boots" width=2184 height=3500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1232558764-6454f914b9f80.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">WPA Pool</span><p>The Princess of Wales - pictured here in 2021 -&nbsp;has been wearing her trusty Penelope Chilvers boots for nearly a decade</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was one of the first times a young Kate Middleton had caused a rush on a particular piece. "I was still starting out at the time, and the phone didn't stop ringing for days," says Chilvers. "And each time Kate wears her 'old faithfuls', yes, the sales go up." Does she really still wear the same pair she bought all those years ago? "Of course!

The Duchess of Sussex – who arguably understands a good photo opportunity better than any of the other royals – is a fan of jewellery designer Roxanne First. She wore the brand's Snake hoop earrings to the Endeavour Awards with Prince Harry in 2020, which was the couple's final appearance as working senior royals. Images of them, holding hands under an umbrella as rain lashed down, became some of the most famous ever taken of the pair, and were beamed around the world.</p><img alt="london, united kingdom march 05 embargoed for publication in uk newspapers until 24 hours after create date and time meghan, duchess of sussex attends the endeavour fund awards at mansion house on march 5, 2020 in london, england photo by max mumbyindigogetty images" title="The Duke And Duchess Of Sussex Attend The Endeavour Fund Awards" width=2063 height=2620 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1210679568-64528f16ae159.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Duchess of Sussex at the Endeavour Awards, wearing Roxanne First</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was quite an iconic set of images, which did go fairly viral at the time," says First. "I love seeing our jewellery being worn by all our clients, but it felt especially good to see the duchess wearing these hoops at such an important event. The next day, we were inundated with orders for these gold hoops, and a clear majority of sales came from the US. It was a phenomenal amount of orders!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sales for the hoops increased by 500 per cent after Meghan wore them, and the US is now a top-three market for the brand. "Being worn by a royal definitely has the power to raise brand profile as well as awareness," says First. "It's also a huge compliment to be worn by one of the royals, especially as we are fairly young brand." First only launched her brand in 2018; now, she's stocked by all the major retailers worldwide.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><img alt="the duchess of sussex broke royal rules with a statement manicure at the fashion awards" title="The Duchess of Sussex broke royal rules with a statement manicure at the Fashion Awards" width=2000 height=2500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-dark-nails-fashion-awards-2-1544523518.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeff Spicer/BFC</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Meghan wearing Pippa Small bangles at the Fashion Awards in 2018</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jewellery designer Pippa Small also noticed an incredible increase in sales after Meghan made a surprise appearance at the Fashion Awards in 2018, when she was pregnant with Archie.

We'd been growing prior to that but, after that day, we doubled in size over the next year."</p><img alt="britains catherine, duchess of cambridge attends a beating retreat by the massed pipes and drums of the combined cadet force in scotland at the palace of holyroodhouse in edinburgh, scotland on may 27, 2021, the final day of their week long visit to the country photo by jane barlow pool afp photo by jane barlowpoolafp via getty images" title="Kate carrying Strathberry's 'Multrees' wallet" width=2266 height=3400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1233196499-6454fa85e2f0d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jane Barlow</span><p>Kate carrying Strathberry’s Multrees wallet</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Why do they think the royals are so hooked on their brand? "We are very focused on craftsmanship and quality, but we still sell at an affordable price," says Leeanne. "We make our products alongside Loewe, Dior and Caroline Herrera, who use the same workshops and leather as us. But we're up in Edinburgh, a bit removed from the fashion centres, and we try to be original in what we create."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The stardust the royals can bestow on a brand isn't, however, a guaranteed golden ticket. Issa London was a relatively niche label before a young Kate Middleton wore several of its pieces, eventually choosing a navy blue wrap dress for her engagement announcement to Prince William in 2010 – a moment that turned everything upside down. "In 2008 and 2009 we were in serious financial trouble," Helayel has previously said. "When Kate wore that dress everything changed."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"From the day of the royal engagement our sales doubled – but I didn’t have the money to finance production on that scale. The bank refused to give me credit, and the factory was screaming for me to pay its bills. I needed an investor."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over the next five years, the brand struggled with a new leadership team and Helayel's departure. Camilla Al-Fayed became the company's new majority stakeholder and, eventually, Issa shuttered in December 2015.</p><img alt="clarence house announce the engagement of prince william to kate middleton" title="Clarence House Announce The Engagement Of Prince William To Kate Middleton" width=2142 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-william-and-kate-middleton-pose-for-photographs-in-news-photo-1683625798.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Chris Jackson</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Kate wearing an Issa London dress for her engagement announcement in 2010</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Strathberry's Guy Hundleby, the key to staying on top of the 'Kate effect' – and, really, the effect every royal bestows – lies in building longevity beyond certain pieces and fads. "You’ve got to be careful, because if you build too much on something like that, it can create a risk," he says. "Inevitably, the hype calms down a bit, and you need to make sure the brand is building up alongside that incredible opportunity. It’s a fantastic moment in time, but it doesn’t define you – it’s just part of your journey."</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop the royals'
