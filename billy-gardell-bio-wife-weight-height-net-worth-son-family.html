His parents’ marriage ended in divorce when he was still a child. Consequently, he moved to Florida with his mother and siblings.

On December 28, 1987, he was pressured by his coworkers to perform at the open mic night of a comedy club in Orlando, which resulted in him losing a bet to them. Interestingly, this was Gardell’s first chance at stand-up comedy, and it was an unofficial start to his showbiz career. He received a positive response to this first stage performance, and so he was encouraged to perform at several other open mic nights at the same club. After finding his rhythm in comedy, he decided to pursue a full-time career in this art and was eventually offered a job at the comedy club. He also performed in several cities in the United States.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is David Koresh?
