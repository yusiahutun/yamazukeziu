Love Is Blind, which first premiered on <a href=# id=auto-tag_netflix data-tag=netflix>Netflix</a> in February 2020, follows 30 men and women over the course of 10 days as they speed-date in “Pods,” where they can talk to each other but not see each other. During the 10 days, the couples can decide if they want to get engaged—still sight unseen. After the proposal, the couples meet face-to-face for the first time and go on vacation at a resort in Mexico, where they learn more about each other and meet the other couples. After the trip, the couples, who all live in the same city, return to the real world and move into an apartment together as they meet each other’s families and friends and prepare for their weddings. At the altar on their wedding days, the couples must decide whether to marry or breakup as they answer the age-old question of if love can be truly blind.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Since the premiere of <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind</a>, the show has become one of Netflix’s highest-rated series, with more than 30 million views in its first two months.”Across the world, everybody feels the same way: Everyone wants to be loved for who they are on the inside. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you look like, how old you are, what your background is, which class you know, or social structure you feel like you’re a part of, everyone wants to be loved for who they are,” creator Chris Coelen told Variety in 2020. “In today’s society we’ve got all these ways to find love through dating apps and technology. Those things sort of counterintuitively have made people feel disposable. They’ve made people feel like it’s all surface level. It does the opposite thing it was supposed to do. So we thought, what if we took everybody’s devices away, how could we get them to focus on connecting with other people?”</p><p>Coelen also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> about how&nbsp;the connections on <a href=# rel=noopener>Love Is Blind </a>was based on choice, which is why the relationships were that much stronger. “It was incredibly scary because nobody had to do anything, versus a show like we do Married at First Sight, you sign up and you know, you’re getting married to a stranger. Here, nobody had to do anything. It was if you find someone, if you choose. Which is so scary. They don’t have to go through with the wedding ceremony,” he said. “But assuming they found someone, could that love overcome any judgment in the real world? That’s an incredibly fascinating question. And that’s what we set out to try to examine.”</p><p>So are <a href=# rel=noopener>Jarrette and Iyanna still together from Love Is Blind</a> season 2? Read on for what we know about where Jarrette and Iyanna from Love Is Blind season 2 are now and if their on-screen relationship continued off screen.</p><h2>Are Jarrette and Iyanna still together from Love Is Blind season 2?</h2><p>Are Jarrette Jones and Iyanna McNeely still together from Love Is Blind season 2? The answer is no. Jarrette, a 32-year-old project manager, and Iyanna, a 27-year-old program coordinator, met and got engaged in The Pods on Love Is Blind season 2, and got married at their wedding in the finale. So…are Jarrette and Iyanna still together from Love Is Blind season 2? The answer is maybe. Both Jarrette and Iyanna follow each other on Instagram.</p><p><span>During episode 1, Jarrette and Iyanna bonded over their senses of humor and their love of children. “Did you say you want? My goodness, do you want half of a starting lineup?” Jarrette joked. “I want a big family. I didn’t have one growing up cause I was an only child and it was kind of lonely,” Iyanna said. Iyanna then confessed to Jarrette that her biological mother raised her until she was 9, at which time she was taken in by her cousin until she was 18, at which point she was kicked out of the house and was adopted by her godparents at 22. “I had so many odds against me. I should not be this OK,” Iyanna said. Jarrette, however, also had a relationship with Mallory, a 32-year-old communications manager. In episode 3, Jarrette proposed to Mallory who turned him down because of her stronger feelings for Sal, a 31-year-old executive assistant. “Since the beginning, I’ve connected with you so well. We have so much in common, and I could talk to you about everything,” she said. “It’s fun and I laugh with you a lot. I love talking to you all the time. You’re such an amazing person, but there’s always really been two people I’ve felt very strongly for and I feel my other connection I’m just drawn more to that.”</span></p><p>After Mallory’s rejection, Jarrette proposed to Iyanna, who had reservations about him because of his relationship with Mallory. “I can’t help but to think if Mallory had yes, then you would have proposed to her. I don’t know how I feel about that. I deserve someone who wants to be certain about me,” Iyanna said. Jarrette told Iyanna that Mallory’s rejection gave him the “validation” he needed to go all in on his relationship with Iyanna. After they worked out their differences, Jarrette proposed to Iyanna, which she accepted, and the two got engaged and met face-to-face outside of The Pods. They hit a bump in their relationship, however, at the retreat when Mallory and Jarrette met face-to-face for the first time and bonded again over their shared interests. During the conversation, Mallory told Jarrette about how he and Sal were different. “I’m such a guy’s girl,” Mallory said, to which Jarrette responded, “Hence why the fuck we connected.” Mallory continued, “I fucking wanna catch a game. That’s who I am. That’s what I love. It’s so easy. Most men that are into sports and things like that, that connect with me in that aspect, they don’t make me a priority.” Jarrette then tells Mallory that Sal didn’t get her the ring she wanted and that he knew the ring to get her, which she confirmed.</p><p>In episode 5, Iyanna confronted Jarrette over his conversation with Mallory. “Seeing him talk with Mallory, I was thinking that maybe he’d regret his choice,” Iyanna said in a confessional interview. “I do trust him. He’s a grown man. What would break my heart is if he lied to me. If he lied to me, that’s a deal-breaker.” Jarrette and Iyanna got married during their wedding in episode 10. Jarrette and Ayanna announced they were divorcing in August 2022, a month after they celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary. “After much thought, we’re saddened to share that we have separated and will begin the process of divorcing,” they wrote in a joint Instagram statement at the time. “While we have love for each other, our lives are going in different directions and that’s OK. Coming to this decision was far from easy and we will always wish each other the absolute best.”</p><p>The statement continued: “We hope you all will give us some space as we close this chapter of our lives. Thank you to our close friends and family for loving us both through our experience. To the Love Is Blind family and Netflix, thank you for this unforgettable opportunity and support.” Ayanna and Jarrette were still together in the Love Is Blind: After the Altar special, which aired in September 2022, a month after they announced their divorce.</p><h2>Who is Jarrette from Love Is Blind season 2?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Jarrette-Love-Is-Blind.jpg><p>Who is Jarrette Jones from Love Is Blind season 2?
