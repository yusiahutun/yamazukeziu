It's why he's here, in every sense of the word.</p><p class=p1>"I was sitting in a prison cell and I was watching my family and my life and my world that I built completely crumble outside of the walls," the Nashville rapper-turned-country-singer confesses.</p><p class=p1>"I had completely no control. My kids ended up in foster care, mother of my children overdosed and passed away. I realized there was nothing I could do to control what was happening on the outside. All I could do was control how I came out and who I was. And I was over it."</p><p class=p1>This transformation came&nbsp;about a decade ago, when Jennings (real name William Harness) was at the Northeast Correctional Complex in Mountain City, Tenn. He was looking at 13 years in prison after being arrested on — as he'd later tell <a href=#>All Hip Hop</a> — charges of conspiracy for very large quantities of cocaine and marijuana.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-struggle on waylon</span></p>Getty Images<p>loading...</p></figure><p class=p1>Ultimately he'd serve less than half that time, but it was time well-served, if you judge the process by the results. Jennings says he lost&nbsp;more than 100 pounds and tore down&nbsp;a value system that included concepts like "it's alright to do a little wrong for the right reasons." He began to recognize that every good and bad thing that happened in his life — especially events that led to imprisonment — were results of his decisions.</p><p class=p1>“I was a drug dealer for a long time, and I felt like I didn’t really have a victim," he shares. "I didn’t feel like I was out there hurting anybody. I was trying to justify that I was doing it for my kids. In the end, they (seven of them total) became the victims.”</p><p class=p1>Songwriting became an outlet. Long hailed as one of Nashville's top rappers, Jennings started to lean into his country roots with albums like Waylon & Willie. This trilogy of <a href=#>Jelly Roll</a> collaborations opened more doors for him, and he walked through them when it felt right. Through it all, he tried to remain true to&nbsp;values learned from his grandfather, country legend Waylon Jennings. The two have more in common than you'd guess.</p><p class=p1>Jennings spoke to Taste of Country from his home in the Nashville area. In December he released a new song called "Drinking Alone," from an album called Monte Carlo,&nbsp;which he expects to release this April. <a href=#>Billy Ray Cyrus </a>and <a href=#>Lorrie Morgan</a> are country artists he confirmed&nbsp;to be collaborating with him on the project.</p><p><strong>Taste of Country: Jelly Roll (<a href=#>talking to ToC</a> in December) and <a href=#>Brantley Gilbert</a> (one month prior) both mentioned you as the next artist with a chance to break into country music. Who was the first person&nbsp;who opened a door for you to elevate your career on a mainstream level?</strong></p><p>Struggle Jennings: It’s been a long ride, man. I started in the early 2000s just blending the genres, just out of what I felt was right and what was real to me, growing up in the ‘80s loving rap music, but having the soundtrack in the backdrop of country and Southern rock. Then I went away for a little while at the start of just starting to release that music, and having that career.</p><p>Coming home, Yelawolf was playing a big role in that movement. Jelly Roll was playing a huge part in that movement. I just came in and fell in line. It was kind of what I began and helped birth. Over the last few years, what me and Jelly did, the Waylon & Willie series, which just opened so many doors.</p>"Watching my grandfather and my dad put those cowboy boots on, and the cowboy hat ... It was always a larger-than-life persona, that cowboy look. It was something that I always loved, so when I did finally decide to embrace it and not be confined to what was cool, it felt real and it felt whole, and it made me feel like I was being who I really wanted to be."<p>So I guess it hasn’t been one person as much as it’s been a movement of people. Of course there’s that whole country-rap genre — it gets really misconstrued and the lines get blurred real easily. But what me and Jelly and guys like Yelawolf have done, and continue to do, I think there is just no running from it.</p><p><strong>To what degree are you a student of Waylon Jennings' music and catalog?</strong></p><p>He was my grandfather. My mother sang backup (for him) the first 10 years of my life, so she was gone a lot, but in the summertime or chances when I wasn’t in school, I’d get to go on the road. So I got it firsthand, backstage, watching him walk out on that stage. More or less a student of him as a man and who he was as a father and grandfather and artist, than just the music itself.</p><p><strong>What similarities do you see between his music and your music?</strong></p><p>We definitely aren’t confined to any boxes. Back then they said he wasn’t country music. It was too rock&nbsp;'n' roll, too this, too that, too edgy. Now if you think about country music or what somebody says is "real" country music, they mention Waylon. I think we’ll have the same effect, me and the guys doing what we do. It’s authentic and it’s real and it’s not confined to a box.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-waylon and willie album</span></p>Jelly Roll Records<p>loading...</p></figure><p><strong>How would you describe the music you're making for the Monte Carlo album?</strong></p><p>The best way to explain the album is, I bought an ’84 Monte Carlo SS. When I got in it, started it up, felt that nostalgia, smelled the motor, smelled the seats — the static-y radio you can barely get a channel to lock all the way in — it brought me back to this moment … to a place, amongst all the chaos of the world and this industry and my career and being a father and husband and having a lot on my shoulders, the simplicity of just being in that car. There’s not even a plug to plug your phone up — it was peaceful. I wanted an album that embodied that nostalgia.</p><p><strong>Vocally, your voice is different today than it was 10 or 12 years ago. What changed to develop that raspy sound?</strong></p><p>I couldn’t tell you. I fell like when I was bigger — because I lost 130 pounds when I was in prison — my voice was actually higher when I was bigger. Then, the older I get and the more&nbsp;s--t I go through, I don’t know what it is, it’s gotten a lot more growly.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>The 30 Best Country Rap Songs of All Time, Ranked</h2><p>"Old Town Road" is just the tip of the iceberg.
