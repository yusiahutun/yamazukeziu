What you should know</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p class=align-left><strong>Jason Cochran's death was one of the saddest murder cases in the United States. However, it is also remembered as the incident that brought together two lovebirds. Laura Frizzo and Jeremy Ogden were working on separate cases that involved Kelly Cochran when they bumped into each other. The love for each other was irresistible. They started dating and even got engaged. So, are Laura Frizzo and Jeremy Ogden married?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ac1f7219c9e3d697.jpg><p class=align-left>They say that love is beautiful, and it takes two to make it work. It can also come from unlikely situations and places. For instance, the former Iron River Police Chief, Frizzo and the former Hobart Indiana detective, Jeremy Ogden. Here is everything you should know.</p><h2>Who are Laura Frizzo and Jeremy Ogden?</h2><p class=align-left>Frizzo was a police officer from Iron River. On the other hand, Jeremy Ogden is an Indian detective. The pair were catapulted into the limelight because of a case involving the murder of Jason Cochran.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d5ad3bf23cc0ba8e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Christina Raines now: Latest updates of Drew Peterson's ex-girlfriend</span></p></a><h2>How did Laura Frizzo and Jeremy Ogden meet?</h2><p class=align-left>Laura Frizzo was looking into the case of Christopher Regan's disappearance. Therefore, when she heard that he had been in an affair with a married woman, she began looking for the woman. Frizzo questioned his former lover, Kelly Cochran and her husband, Jason Cochran.</p><p class=align-left>However, after Laura had searched their house and gathered enough evidence, Kelly and Jason fled to Indiana. They left everything behind. Nonetheless, Laura and her team continued with investigations, interviewing the neighbours.</p><p class=align-left>As Frizzo's team struggled to make headway in Regan's disappearance, another death occurred. Authorities in Indiana received a 911 call reporting the death of Jason Cochran. Jason had a large amount of heroin in his body and appeared to have had an overdose. However, the autopsy report ruled that his cause of death was actually asphyxiation.</p><p class=align-left>During<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> the investigations</a> into these separate cases, Jeremy and Frizzo met. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0348febfb85ca7fa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bill Payne and Billie Jean Hayworth murders: What really happened?</span></p></a><h2>What happened to Jason Cochran?</h2><p class=align-left>Kelly called Jeremy Ogden and asked to meet in person. During the meeting, she eventually <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">informed him that</a> her husband had killed Regan. He also agreed that she had lured Regan into their house.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, she revealed that she and Jason had taken an oath on <a href=#>their wedding night</a>. They had agreed that if one cheated on the other, the one who cheated would murder their lover. However, if they failed to do it, the spouse would kill do it on their behalf.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d5ad3bf23cc0ba8e.jpg><p class=align-left>Therefore, since she could not kill Christopher Regan, her husband shot him instead. Kelly then agreed to take Laura Frizzo to where the dismembered body of Regan had been buried. However, she was arrested and charged with the murder of Regan and her husband.</p><h2>Where is Kelly Cochran now?</h2><p class=align-left>Kelly is in the Michigan Department of Corrections custody, housed at Huron Valley Women's Complex. She is quite possibly a serial killer with at least two confirmed murders. In addition, she is a master manipulator, pathological liar, and self-described psychopath. Therefore, because of the tenacity of Laura Frizzo, she will never be free again.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ba1fb49a23930fe0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Bobbie Jo Stinnett's daughter, Victoria Stinnett?</span></p></a><h2>Are Laura Frizzo and Jeremy Ogden married?</h2><p class=align-left>Interestingly, the murder case created a new life for the two main investigators, Laura and Jeremy. The two became lovers and got engaged later. Indeed, as Frizzo would later put it, 'Something good came out of something so horrible.'</p><p class=align-left>To date, the two have kept their <a href=#>relationship affairs</a> under wraps. Therefore, it is impossible to tell whether they are married or not.</p><h2>Where is Laura Frizzo now?</h2><p class=align-left>It is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">not possible to tell </a>where Laura Frizzo is at the moment. David Thayer fired her due to irreconcilable differences. It remains unclear what these irreconcilable differences are, but it is said she was fired after some altercation with the council agenda.</p><p class=align-left>After being fired, Laura appeared in the high court on different occasions. She was demanding justice in court. However, it is also not clear about the outcome of her quest.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4f18da9befdaee2d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jenny Jones murder updates, documentary, and lawsuit update</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you have been asking "Are Laura Frizzo and Jeremy Ogden married?" the pair has been silent since their engagement.
