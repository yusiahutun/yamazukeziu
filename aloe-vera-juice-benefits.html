But in addition to these <a href=#>beauty perks</a>, aloe vera juice benefits the whole body when you drink it — either straight or added to a smoothie.</p><p>Indeed, “Aloe boasts compounds that reduce inflammation, soothe pain and improve muscle contraction in the GI tract,” says Gary Null, PhD, author of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Complete Encyclopedia of Natural Healing</a>. Read on for more health benefits of this tasty sip.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Aloe Vera Juice Benefits the Thyroid</h2><p>For starters, aloe vera juice soothes the gut. Why is this important? When the gut is inflamed, as it is for so many women, it can’t absorb proven thyroid-supporting nutrients from our diet, like selenium, iodine, zinc and vitamin C. As a result, we often wind up with the classic symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, such as fatigue, brain fog, low energy and brittle hair. Experts note that when folks eat in a way that reduces gut inflammation, they increase their intake of thyroid-healing nutrients by up to 1,000%.</p><p>Women who struggle with the symptoms of a sluggish thyroid — depression, tiredness, and thinning hair — might have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hashimoto’s thyroiditis</a>, an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune-fighting messaging system — rooted in the gut — is overrun by inflammation and attacks the “master gland” critical for energy, mood, digestion and weight. In fact, “more than 90% of women with low thyroid have Hashimoto’s,” confirms ‘Thyroid Pharmacist’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Izabella Wentz, PharmD,</a> who wrote <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hashimoto’s Protocol</a> after curing her own thyroid disease. She’s a fan of drinking naturally anti-inflammatory aloe vera juice to benefit thyroid health.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>This Trace Soil Element Could Be Just What Your Thyroid Is Crying Out For If You’re Tired, Foggy and Can’t Lose Weight</a></p><p>“The best way to stop an autoimmune attack on the thyroid is by following an anti-inflammatory diet to heal the gut damage that triggers the attack,” agrees <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emi Hosoda, MD</a>. She healed her thyroid condition and lost 100 pounds eating and drinking anti-inflammatory foods. (Click through to learn how <a href=#>anti-inflammatory aloe also helps heal hemorrhoids.</a>)</p><p>What’s more, “aloe vera juice also feeds the ‘good’ bacteria in our gut that support immunity and proper thyroid function,” explains <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taz Bhatia, MD</a>. In this way, the juice functions as a “prebiotic” food for gut bugs.&nbsp;Indeed, in a study published in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical & Translational Endocrinology</a>, subjects drinking 1 to 2 oz. of food-grade aloe vera juice first thing in the morning reduced thyroid-damaging antibodies by 58% over nine months. Lead author Daniela Metro, PhD, stumbled on the cure when dealing with her own subclinical case of <a href=#>Hashimoto’s</a>. Metro says, “The drink decreases the burden of thyroid autoimmune inflammation.” (Thyroid conditions can also cause vision-hampering dry eye.

Keep reading to learn how.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aloe vera juice eases heartburn.</h2><p>Aloe vera drinks can help <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nip heartburn in the bud</a>, according to Chinese researchers. They credit the 200+ compounds in the sip that prevent inflammation in the esophagus and supercharge the production of reflux-fighting enzymes, which can reduce heartburn flare-up frequency.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aloe vera juice soothes sore joints.</h2><p>Aloe vera juice is rich in two plant compounds (salicylic acid and sterols) that suppress joint inflammation and stop fluid buildup in the joints. And according to an animal study in Central European Journal of Immunology, sipping just 1 oz. daily can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slash joint pain and swelling</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aloe vera juice balances blood sugar.</h2><p>Plant compounds in <a href=#>aloe vera juice</a> (phytosterols) improve cells’ ability to absorb and utilize sugar. The payoff: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Researchers</a> found this effect helped subjects given a daily dose of aloe vera reduce their fasting blood-sugar levels more than those taking a placebo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aloe vera juice eases bladder pain.</h2><p>Taking aloe vera juice in a freeze-dried capsule form markedly reduces the discomfort of a painful bladder condition known as interstitial cystitis. Within just 3 months, women who took the supplement daily had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">less pelvic pain and pressure</a>, and reduced urinary urgency. (Click through to discover more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interstitial cystitis natural treatment</a> options.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How To Consume Aloe Vera Juice</h2><p>It’s easy to experience the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">skin perks of aloe</a> with a topical cream (or, in some cases, by breaking a leaf off the plant and rubbing the gel directly on your skin), but you need to drink aloe juice to get the full-body perks. For best results, top doctors like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vincent Pedre, MD</a>, recommend sipping it in the morning on an empty stomach. “Aloe vera juice is powerful,” assures Dr. Pedre. “Many of my patients add a tablespoon of store-bought aloe vera juice to their smoothies or just drink a shot of it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where To Get Aloe Vera Juice</h2><p>You can buy food-grade aloe vera juice (like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynamic Health Aloe Vera Barbadensis Miller Juice</a>, $12.99 for 32 oz., Vitacost.com) in health-food stores or online, or you can stir a spoonful of aloe vera powder into 8 oz. of water or tea. Dr. Pedre suggests looking for powder blends with gut-supportive nutrients, such as slippery elm, herbal licorice root or cat’s claw. His product, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Enhance</a> (available at HappyGutLife.com), fits the bill.</p><p>You can also make your own aloe vera juice. To do: Slice off a 1″ section from an aloe houseplant or from an aloe vera leaf (found in the produce department in some grocery stores) scoop out the raw pulp (the inner gel or “meat”) and thoroughly rinse or soak to eliminate bitterness. Then blend it into 8 oz. of water.</p><p>Even better, you can mix food-grade aloe vera juice into a number of drinks. Here, deliciously sweet sips made with aloe vera juice to help you look and feel your best. Try one today! (Note that aloe has a mild laxative effect, so doctors recommend you start slowly, sipping 1 Tbs. a day, and slowly building up to 1⁄2 cup&nbsp;a day.)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3 Delicious Recipes To Get You Started</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Blueberry Smoothie Blast</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_427799287.jpg><p>1 cup frozen blueberries<strong></strong></p><p>1 banana</p><p>4 oz. aloe vera juice<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong>1 Tbs. honey</p><p>In blender, puree all ingredients with 1 cup of water.</p><p><strong>Makes 2 servings</strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cucumber Mojito Mocktail</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/shutterstock_547844992.jpg><p>1 ⁄4 cup mint leaves</p><p>1 ⁄4 cup sugar</p><p>1 cucumber,<strong> </strong>sliced</p><p>1 ⁄ 2 cup lime-flavored sparkling water</p><p>4 oz. aloe vera juice</p><p>Cook mint, sugar and 1 ⁄4 cup of water 5 min.; let cool.
