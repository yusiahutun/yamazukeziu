They share three daughters: Wyatt Elizabeth; Elliotte Ray; and Bennett Lllewellyn. During an interview on Jason and Travis’ podcast, “New Heights,” in September 2023, Kylie joked about how she didn’t trust her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">brother-in-law</a> to babysit her and Jason’s three kids.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/castor-oil-brow-growth-amazon.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/revlon-lipstick.png><p>“How long, if at all, would you allow me to babysit the girls unsupervised? Longer than Jason?” Travis asked on the podcast, to which Kylie responded, “But then who is watching you?” She continued, “To be fair, when I left today, Wyatt said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on him, mom.'”</p><p>She then revealed the amount of time she would leave Travis alone with her kids. “I’d probably leave you for one hour,” she said. “I’d leave you with Wyatt, you can handle Wyatt,” Jason added, to which Kylie agreed.</p><p>Jokes aside, Kylie told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a> in February 2023 that Travis made the “absolute best” uncle to her daughters. “It’s very funny, Jason said in an interview that he thinks [the girls] might like him more than they like Jason,” she said. “I tell everybody, he comes to our house to visit and the poor guy doesn’t sit on the couch because our daughters will be like, ‘No, no, you sit on the floor. We’re gonna do a puzzle. We’re gonna build blocks. We’re gonna do this, we’re gonna do that.'”</p><p>Kylie revealed that she’s tried to tell Travis that he can turn down their kids’ many requests. “Our oldest, she’s our boss. She’s our ring leader, and she just has demand after demand for him. And I’m like, ‘Trav, you know you can tell Wyatt no?'” she said. “He was like ‘Yeah, I don’t think I can.’ And so he will do it. She’ll be like, ‘Jump up and down.’ He’ll do it. ‘Roll on the floor,’ he’ll do it. ‘Be the pony.’ He’ll do it. So he’s all-in when it comes to being an uncle. He is the epitome of an uncle, just through and through.”</p><p>So who is <a href=#>Jason Kelce’s wife, Kylie McDevitt</a>, and how did they meet? Read on for what we know about <a href=# id=auto-tag_jason-kelce data-tag=jason-kelce>Jason Kelce</a>‘s wife, Kylie McDeVitt, and their whirlwind relationship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-did-jason-kelce-and-his-wife-kylie-mcdevitt-meet-1>How did Jason Kelce and his wife Kylie McDeVitt meet?</h2><p>How did Jason <a href=# id=auto-tag_kelce data-tag=kelce>Kelce</a> and his wife Kylie McDevitt meet? In Prime Video’s 2023 documentary, Kelce, Kylie revealed that she and Jason met on Tinder and didn’t even know he was an NFL player. “Jason won’t let me lie about this. We met on Tinder,” she said. “None of his pictures showed Eagles football.”</p><p>Though she didn’t know he was an NFL player, Kylie and her friends felt he looked “kind of familiar” from his profile. After she learned who he was from Google image searching his profile, Kylie assumed the account was. “It can’t be him; it’s a catfish,” she said. Still, she agreed to go on a first date with him because she felt it would be “hilarious either way” if Jason showed up or someone who was “pretending to be him.”</p><p>Kylkie revealed that she and Jason had their first date at a bar, which lasted 45 minutes as Jason fell asleep. “Forty-five minutes later, he fell asleep at the bar, like just, out, like asleep, asleep,” she said. “The next day, he called and was like, can we try that again?” She added that Jason “did much better” at impressing her the second time they went out.</p><p>Kylie explained what drew her to Jason’s Tinder profile in an interview on his and Travis’ podcast, “New Heights,” in September 2023. “His profile at the time was something along the lines of, ‘I want to have deep meaningful conversations and talk about getting married and having kids,'” she said.</p><p>Kylie also recalled how Jason “fell asleep” on their first date “because he was too drunk.” She remembered how Jason’s Egles team mate, Bo Allen, “accomplished the most accomplished physical feat of his life when he fireman carried back to his apartment.” Jason, for his part, revealed on the podcast that he was “sober enough to know” that Kylie “the most beautiful woman I had ever seen in my life” before explaining that their second date “went much better.”</p><p>Jason and Kylie went public with their relationship on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> on November 11, 2014. “Thank goodness you swiped right too,” Kylie captioned a black-and-white photo of her and Jason. Jason and Kylie married on April 14, 2018, at the Logan Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Jason played for the Philadelphia Eagles. Their wedding was attended by 70 guests including Jason’s 20-pound Irish wolfhound, Winnie, whom he welcomed in May 2017. The wedding came two months after the Eagles won the Super Bowl LII.</p><p>Jason and Kylie welcomed their first child, a daughter named Wyatt Elizabeth Kelce, on October 2, 2019. Jason told reporters at the time that he and Kylie were originally thinking “Wyatt” for a boy and “Charlotte” for a girl but their friends took “Charlotte” first so they decided on “Wyatt,” since they liked the name “regardless” of the gender. “Chunked up the Deuces on her way out,” Jason captioned an Instagram photo after Wyatt’s birth of his daughter flashing a peace sign as she rested on Kylie’s chest.</p><p>Jason and Kylie’s second child, a daughter named Elliotte Ray Kelce, was born on March 4, 2021. Their third child, a daughter named Bennett Lllewellyn Kelce, was born on February 23, 2023. “Yesterday little lady #3 joined us,” Jason and Kylie captioned a joint Instagram post at the time of Bennett.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-jason-kelce-s-wife-kylie-mcdevitt>Who is Jason Kelce’s wife Kylie McDevitt?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Jason-Kelce-Wife-3.jpg><p>Who is Jason Kelce’s wife, Kylie McDevitt?
