Let's see which is better.</p><h2 id=design-and-durability>Design and Durability</h2><ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23:</strong> 146.3 x 70.9 x 7.6 mm; 168 grams; IP68 water and dust resistant</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5:</strong> Unfolded: 165.1 x 71.9 x 6.9 mm; Folded: 85.1 x 71.9 x 15.1 mm; 187 grams; IPX8 water-resistant</li></ul><p>When unfolded, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 looks like a regular phone; it's taller, broader, slimmer, and heavier than its rival. The Galaxy S23 is positioned as a compact device, but since the Flip 5 can fold in half, it's a lot more portable too. So, the Flip wins in terms of design.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both devices use an aluminum frame and have Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection on the back. However, the Flip 5's flexible and fragile main screen made of plastic and Ultra Thin Glass (UTG) stands no chance against the tough Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front of the S23.</p><p>You could argue that the main screen on the Flip 5 is going to be protected since the device is meant to be closed when not in use—a perfectly valid point. However, do consider that after a year of using the Flip, it's likely that its crease is going to become more prominent after being opened and closed many times each day.</p><p>Also, don't forget that the device comes with an IPX8 rating which means it's water-resistant but not dust-resistant whereas its rival is protected against both. So, all things considered, the Galaxy S23 is likely to be more durable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=camera>Camera</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flip-5-camera-in-use.jpg><ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23:</strong> 50MP f/1.8 primary, OIS, 8K video at 30fps; 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide (120-degree field of view); 10MP f/2.4 telephoto, OIS, 3x optical zoom; Front: 12MP f/2.2 camera, 4K video at 60fps</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5:</strong> 12MP f/1.8 primary, OIS, 4K video at 60fps; 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide (123-degree FoV); Front: 10MP f/2.2, 4K video at 30fps</li></ul><p>The Galaxy S23 has a better camera system overall due to its higher resolution main and selfie cameras plus a telephoto lens on the rear for portrait shots. The Flip 5 is limited to a main and ultrawide lens and cannot shoot 8K video. Although, we doubt many people actually shoot in 8K as it's one of the most <a href=#>overhyped smartphone features</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Don't forget that you can use the main camera on the Flip 5 to shoot selfies in FlexCam mode which will be of much higher quality than shots from the selfie camera of the Galaxy S23.</p><h2 id=display>Display</h2><ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23:</strong> 6.1-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED; 120Hz adaptive refresh rate; 1080 x 2340 resolution; 425 PPI; 1750 nits peak brightness</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5:</strong> Main screen: 6.7-inch Foldable Dynamic AMOLED 2X display; 120Hz refresh rate; 1080 x 2640 resolution; 426 PPI; 1200 nits peak brightness; Cover screen: 3.4-inch Super AMOLED display; 60Hz refresh rate; 748 x 720 resolution</li></ul><p>The Galaxy S23 has a shorter, brighter, and stronger display panel than the Flip 5. Conversely, the Flip 5 retains a bigger main display and also exposes a new 3.4-inch cover screen, called the Flex Window, when folded shut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're trying to <a href=#>make a TikTok video</a>, for example, you can place the Flip 5 upright anywhere you want at almost any angle and use its cover screen to see and record yourself. This isn't possible on a traditional smartphone and is one of the <a href=#>best features of the Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>.</p><p>You can also use the Flex Window to check your notifications, read your emails, reply to messages, or make payments.</p><h2 id=ram-and-storage>RAM and Storage</h2><ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23:</strong> 8GB RAM; 128GB/256GB/512GB storage</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5:</strong> 8GB RAM; 256GB/512GB storage</li></ul><p>Both devices have 8GB of RAM, but the Flip 5 starts at 256GB of storage on the base model—just like the S23+ and S23 Ultra—whereas its rival starts at 128GB. Neither of the two devices has a microSD card slot for expandable storage.</p><p>You should also note that the Galaxy Z Flip 4 comes with the latest UFS 4.0 storage standard whereas the Galaxy S23's base 128GB variant comes with an inferior UFS 3.1 standard. It's only when you bump up to 256GB or 512GB do you get the faster storage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>UFS 4.0 offers faster app loading times and minimizes buffer, especially when opening and editing large files such as 4K videos. So, the Flip 5 is the clear winner in this category.</p><h2 id=battery>Battery</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/samsung-galaxy-s23-plus-1.jpg><ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S23:</strong> 3900mAh; 25W wired and 15W wireless; reverse wireless charging</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5:</strong> 3700mAh; 25W wired and 15W wireless, reverse wireless charging</li></ul><p>Without a doubt, the Galaxy S23 is going to deliver longer battery life than the Flip 5. That's thanks to its slightly larger 3900mAh cell and adaptive refresh rate compared to the 3700mAh cell on its rival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, note that the difference is likely not going to be colossal since the Flip 5 now uses the same chip as the S23 and will therefore be able to take advantage of its efficiency. Both devices have the same charging speeds and allow reverse wireless charging to power your accessories, and neither comes with a charger in the box.</p><h2 id=the-flip-5-is-less-practical-but-much-cooler>The Flip 5 Is Less Practical, but Much Cooler</h2><p>Both the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and S23 are great devices, but if it's value that you're looking for, the Galaxy S23 is a safer recommendation because it's cheaper and gets the fundamentals right. It has a better camera system, longer battery life, an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, an IP68 rating, a brighter display, and a stronger body.</p><p>Conversely, the Flip 5 can fit a bigger display in a smaller body, meaning you're not compromising on immersion during media consumption or gaming—all while enjoying extra portability. It also has the same chip as the S23, so performance and efficiency should be almost identical too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not to mention that it has more and faster storage on the base variant, can stand upright on its own, use the primary camera system to take high-quality selfies, and looks fashionable. If you're open to trying out something new and want to reduce your screen time, the Flip 5 is well worth a look.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiqmqWjqruoecaao5qwqWLHbrLLoqdmbV2rwG6zwKWYsbFdqH90ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
