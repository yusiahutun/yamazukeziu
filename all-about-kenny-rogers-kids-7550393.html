And I think I crossed that line when I was younger,” he continued. “I really want to be there with my kids and my wife. They’re very important to me and I don’t see enough of them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He later clarified to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>AZ Central</a> that he “accomplished everything and more than I set out to do.” Rogers added, “And I really need to spend some time with my boys. They’re 11 now. I have two older boys. I didn’t spend this time with them and I regret it. I’m 77 now, and you don’t know how much longer you’re gonna last.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer added, “Will I miss the business? Absolutely. I’ll miss the faces of the people that are out there and the laughs and smiles but not as much as I would miss my boys. They’re getting to that age.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rogers <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>died at age 81</a> on March 21, 2020. His family said in a statement that he "passed away peacefully at home from natural causes under the care of hospice and surrounded by his family.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On the one-year anniversary of his death, his family released another statement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's so hard to believe it's been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a year since Kenny left us</a>. As you can imagine, some days are better than others, so we wholeheartedly thank you for your thoughts, prayers and support over the last year. It means so much to us," the statement read.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The memories of Kenny and the kind words you've shared have inspired and uplifted us ... brought tears to our eyes and made us laugh," it continued. "No matter what we're going through on any particular day, we know we will never stop missing him, and we'll forever celebrate the person he was and his extraordinary musical legacy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s everything to know about Kenny Rogers’ five kids.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-carole-lynne-rogers-65></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Carole Lynne Rogers, 65</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rogers’ firstborn child and only daughter is Carole Lynne Rogers, who was born on Sept. 15, 1958, to Rogers and his then-wife Janice Gordon. Rogers was only 19 at the time of her birth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I understood how girls got pregnant and that guys had an obligation when they did,” Rogers wrote in his autobiography, Luck or Something Like It, referring to Gordon's surprise pregnancy. “When my Janice got pregnant, I was fully prepared to take the step into married life. It never occurred to me to walk away from the responsibility.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Rogers and Gordon's relationship didn’t last long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You know what? I loved her,” Rogers later told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Fox News</a> in 2012. “At 19 I thought, ‘This is ok with me.’ That was a thing where her parents thought I’d ruined her life and were determined to break me. It didn’t work, and it’s really sad because I think it could have worked. You can’t say I’m afraid of commitment. I’ve been married five times!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair went their separate ways in 1960, and Rogers didn’t see his daughter often as his music career began to take off. In 1980, PEOPLE reported that Rogers was granted only two hours of weekly visitation with Carole.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rogers eventually lost touch with Carole, and she was adopted by his ex-wife’s second husband.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During his 2012 interview with Fox News, Rogers spoke about their estrangement, acknowledging that they did not keep in contact. “That was my promise to them, that I would be her father but he [his ex-wife’s second husband] would be her Dad, and I don’t want to disrupt that,” he said. “He stepped in at a time that was really awkward for all of us and he became her Dad, and I love him for that. He was a good guy.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kenny-rogers-jr-59></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kenny Rogers Jr., 59</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1963, Rogers married Margo Gladys Anderson, his third wife, who was a mom to a daughter named Shannon. Together, they had Kenny Rogers Jr., born on May 24, 1964.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, the couple divorced in 1975, and Anderson resettled in Palm Springs with Kenny Jr. In the years following their split, Rogers barely saw his son. “I would wish desperately that my relationship with Kenny Jr. were better,” he told PEOPLE in 1980.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 1982 interview with PEOPLE, when Carole was 23 and Kenny Jr. was 17, Rogers said, “As you try to get ahead, it’s too easy to think that these kids are still going to be kids tomorrow and that once you get your current project done, you’ll spend some time with them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Then you say, ‘Well, he’s still a child, after all, so I’ll go ahead and get one more project done,’ ” he continued. “The next thing you know the child is grown up and you can’t relate to him at all.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, Kenny is an actor and composer, known for his work on films like Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping and Get Him to the Greek, among others.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-christopher-cody-rogers-42></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Christopher Cody Rogers, 42</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=28><p>Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection/Getty&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Christopher Cody Rogers was born on Dec. 4, 1981, to Rogers and his fourth wife, Marianne Gordon. He was born at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and Rogers passed out Hershey bars to celebrate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Christopher experienced hyaline membrane disease at birth, a respiratory disorder that was fatal to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>John F Kennedy</a>’s infant son in 1963, but he overcame it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Before I leave in the mornings, I hold him and talk to him and get him to smile,” Rogers told PEOPLE in March 1982. “Every day I see what he’s doing that he didn’t do the day before. I know the hard way that we cannot recapture this age, and I’m not missing those things, because I don’t think I’m going to have another chance. This is it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Rogers and Gordon decided to get a divorce, Christopher took it hard. Rogers recounted telling his son the news during a 2006 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Independent</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I remember when I told him - we were out in a golf cart together - I said, 'Chris, your mom and I are going to get a divorce,' and he started screaming,” he recalled. “I said, 'It's going to be OK, I won't spend as much time with you but the time I spend will be quality time,' and he said, 'But will you still be my dad?' ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“So I told him, 'Of course', and he said, 'I thought Mom was going to remarry and somebody else was going to be my dad and I could never tell people you were my daddy and you wouldn't look at me like I'm your son,' ” he continued. “It was just a 12-year-old sorting out those things in his head, but then he was fine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Christopher is now an actor and director known for his work in The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw and Loneliness.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jordan-edward-rogers-and-justin-charles-rogers-19></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jordan Edward Rogers and Justin Charles Rogers, 19</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kenny Rogers Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jordan Edward Rogers and Justin Charles Rogers were born on July 6, 2004, in Atlanta, Georgia, to Rogers and his fifth wife Wanda Miller.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Boy, has it ever changed my life,” Rogers told PEOPLE in 2006 about his twins. “They say that twins at my age will either make you or break you. Right now I’m leaning towards break. I would kill for the energy they’ve got."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added: "I’m embarrassed to tell you I can’t tell them apart.

"But Wanda hadn't had any kids, so I said, 'That may be your choice now but when you turn 30 your body is going to say, Have a baby now or miss it forever' and she said, 'Not me.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Yet on her 31st birthday Wanda, sure enough, asked, 'Can we have one?' ” the country star added. After doing some "soul-searching," Rogers agreed to try for a baby.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">”So we went for it, and when I was told it was twins, man, I was thrilled,” he told the outlet. “So was Wanda. It wasn't just 'We are going to have a baby' it was totally overwhelming."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the twins got older, they started to realize how famous their dad was.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ll hear Justin say to his friends, ‘My dad’s very famous,’ ” Rogers said on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Bobby Bones Show</a> in 2013, adding: “Last year on New Year’s Eve, we went on a Disney Cruise, and we go over to this Disney Island. We’re coming back to get in line, there’s 200 people in front of us, and I’m standing in line, and Jordan says, ‘Hey Dad.

But maybe anybody who doesn't get it right after five marriages doesn't deserve to!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2023, Justin and Jordan <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>graduated from high school</a>. Rogers' team shared a photo of them on Instagram posing together in their cap and gowns, and the boys bore a striking resemblance to their late father.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Kenny always said 'Friendships come and go, but families are forever.'
