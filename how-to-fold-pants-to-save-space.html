No wardrobe is complete without them. From classic jeans to cozy sweatpants to smart slacks, they‚Äôre some of our most reliable clothes, but figuring out how best to store them is another story. We talked to experts about why you shouldn‚Äôt hang them; four space-saving ways to fold them and several ideas on how to maximize space (one hack involves using bookends!). Now you can keep your pants looking fresh with minimal fuss.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why not just hang pants instead of folding?</h2><p>Most experts agree that while hangers can work well for dress pants, hanging pants can hog up a lot of closet space. And hanging can also cause some pesky problems. If you‚Äôre using a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a hanger with a straight bar that the pants drape over</a>, this can lead to unsightly creases. And if you use <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one with clips that are affixed to the waist</a>. this can leave dents on the waistband. Folding your pants instead of hanging them can be a practical solution.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The 4 best ways to fold pants to save space</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Easiest way to fold pants: Make a rectangle</h3><p>If you try folding pants willy-nilly, they may well end up becoming messy blobs (and wrinkle), so it helps to have a shape in mind. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jane Stoller</a>, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">professional organizer</a> and author of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Decluttering for Dummies</a>, says a rectangle is the way to go. Start by making sure they‚Äôre wrinkle-free and the seams are kept symmetrical. From there, she has a simple folding strategy:</p><li>Lay your pants down on a flat surface and ensure that all seams and edges are aligned.</li><li>Fold your pants in half lengthwise, matching up the inner seams. This creates a long rectangle.</li><li>Fold your pants in half again. You should now have a smaller rectangle that will be easy to store.</li><p>Once you have your pants rectangles, you‚Äôll find that they‚Äôre a breeze to stack. This technique is also easy to modify, as you can fold the pants in thirds once they‚Äôve been folded lengthwise to create an even smaller rectangle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@persilproclean href=#>@persilproclean</a><p>Your space-saving hack for folding jeansüëñ <a title=persilproclean href=#>#persilproclean</a> <a title=cleanclothes href=#>#cleanclothes</a> <a title=homeorganizationhacks href=#>#homeorganizationhacks</a> <a title=laundryday href=#>#laundryday</a> <a title=smellssogood href=#>#smellssogood</a> <a title=howtofold href=#>#howtofold</a> <a title=foldingclothes href=#>#foldingclothes</a> <a title=deepclean href=#>#deepclean</a> <a title=laundrytips href=#>#laundrytips</a> <a title=laundryhacks href=#>#laundryhacks</a> <a title=laundrytok href=#>#laundrytok</a> <a title=lifehacks href=#>#lifehacks</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Sunrise - Official Sound Studio" href=#>‚ô¨ Sunrise ‚Äì Official Sound Studio</a></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Fastest way to fold pants: Roll them up</h3><p>‚ÄúAnother space-saving technique is to roll your pants instead of folding them,‚Äù Stoller says. Rolling your pants might sound strange at first, but it‚Äôs one of the quickest solutions, with just two steps:</p><li>&nbsp;Start by folding the pants in half lengthwise.</li><li>Then roll them up tightly from the cuffs to the waistband.</li><p>And there you have it, a pants roll-up that Stoller says is perfect for a grab-and-go lifestyle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@thefoldinglady href=#>@thefoldinglady</a><p>Reply to @anthonyjordanrogers hope this helps üòÄ <a title=jeans href=#>#jeans</a> <a title=storage href=#>#storage</a> <a title=hack href=#>#hack</a> <a title=tips href=#>#tips</a> <a title=learnontiktok href=#>#learnontiktok</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Love Foolosophy (Originally Performed by Jamiroquai) [Instrumental Version] - Backing Track Central" href=#>‚ô¨ Love Foolosophy (Originally Performed by Jamiroquai) [Instrumental Version] ‚Äì Backing Track Central</a></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1134830751-e1695906406359.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Best way to fold pants: Try file-folding</h3><p>Files aren‚Äôt just for the office! <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Laura Price</a>, a pro organizer who owns <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Home Organisation</a>, says she regularly recommends a technique known as file-folding to her clients. She explains: ‚ÄúFile-folding is a great way to keep your pants easy to access and save space. With file-folding, you can fold an item to match the shape and size of the storage container or drawer so you will always be making the best use of the space.‚Äù Here‚Äôs how to do it:</p><li>Lay out your pants on a flat surface.</li><li>Fold over one leg so it is directly on top of the other.</li><li>Using one hand, tuck in the loose material around the bottom so you have a straight line from the waist to the ankle. Hold it there.</li><li>Use the other hand to take the bottom of the pant leg to meet the top, so it‚Äôs folded in half with the tucked-in material sandwiched in between.</li><li>Starting from one end, fold in a third of the material, then fold again and again until you have a tight shape that feels secure.</li><li>You may want to fold more or less times to best fit the space you have. It‚Äôs a bit of trial and error to get the perfect shape, but once you have it right, the rest of the pairs will be easy.</li><p>File-folding may take a few more steps than other folding techniques, but Price says it‚Äôs worth the time. As a bonus, ‚ÄúFile-folding also means you can store your pants vertically so you see each pair easily and nothing gets lost and forgotten at the bottom of the pile.‚Äù</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@lifewithjusticee href=#>@lifewithjusticee</a><p>Replying to @elenitaisabel94 how to file fold your pants <a title=folding href=#>#folding</a> <a title=dresser href=#>#dresser</a> <a title=dresserorganization href=#>#dresserorganization</a> <a title=ikea href=#>#ikea</a> <a title=ikeadresser href=#>#ikeadresser</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Oblivion - Grimes" href=#>‚ô¨ Oblivion ‚Äì Grimes</a></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Best way to fold jeans: One leg at a time</h3><p>Instead of folding your pants in half, you could try folding them up one leg at a time. It‚Äôs easier than it sounds! Here‚Äôs how you do it:</p><li>Take a pair of pants and lay them out flat.</li><li>Then, take the bottom of the legs and fold them to the top of the pants where the waistband is.</li><li>Now that your pant legs are folded in half, take the folded bottom and bring it to the waistband again.</li><li>Now that both legs of your pants are shorter and folded up, bring the two pant leg sides together.</li><p>This technique, which went viral on TikTok, is particularly effective for jeans.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The 2 best ways to store folded pants</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@effectivespaces href=#>@effectivespaces</a><p>Quick jean fold.

The next step is putting them in a drawer or on the shelf while maintaining the sense of organization and keeping them as accessible as possible.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. In a drawer using drawer dividers</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Gabai</a>, the founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">B. Organized</a>, a member of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">National Association of Productivity & Organizing Professionals</a> and the author of <a href=#>The Art of Organizing: An Artful Guide to an Organized Life</a> is a big fan of drawer dividers. ‚ÄúThey can make a huge difference,‚Äù she enthuses. She recommends the OXO Good Grips Expandable Dresser Drawer Divider (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $22.95 for a 2-pack</a>). ‚ÄúThese handy dividers spring-load to create two or three sections in your drawer,‚Äù she says, which provides a compact area for your folded pants to sit and allows you to find them easily, which means no more digging through your drawer‚Äôs depths!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. On a closet shelf using bookends</h3><p>You can also put your pants on a shelf in your closet. The problem with shelf-stacking is that sometimes the piles can become wobbly, especially if you‚Äôre reaching for pants from the bottom of the pile. Gabai has a genius hack: Bookends! She explains: ‚ÄúUsing slender metal bookends to organize your stacked clothes on a shelf can prevent them from falling over. This allows you to stack items higher, as tall as your bookend, without worrying about them toppling over when you remove something from the middle.‚Äù Turns out they‚Äôre not just for books!
