However, it appears that not living up to her estranged mother’s expectations put a tremendous strain on their relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair had stopped talking back in 1999, after Dow published a book, <i>From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir</i>. Prior to her mother’s stroke in 2011, the star had reportedly not been in contact with her mother for several years leading up to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>her death</a> in 2016.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Tran</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress had previously discussed her difficult relationship with her mother in 2015, sharing how critical Dow was to <i>T<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he Hollywood Reporter</a></i>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She was critical.
