They have selflessly shared their talents, time and lives with others since meeting at Jones College in 2004. Now in its eighth season, their HGTV show “Home Town” has given new life to homes, families and neighborhoods aplenty.</p><p>But the popular stars were themselves given something in a recent episode titled “Homecoming.” Something special and long-lasting that brought tears to the eyes of friends and fans, including even one burly Scotsman host.</p><p>After touring a dilapidated old factory building on campus with the Napiers, Jones College President Dr. Jesse Smith first requested the help of the couple in designing a new school on the property that would be purposed for educating future students in the skills of construction and design.</p><p>Then Smith popped the question: “We wanted to talk about, if it is OK with you, to name this facility the Erin and Ben Napier School of Design and Building Arts?”</p><p>“Seriously,” replied a shocked Erin. “It is kind of unbelievable that they (Jones College) would consider naming a school after us.”</p><p>And with the airing of this special episode of Home Town on Jan. 21 the world was made aware of the Erin and Ben Napier School of Design and Building Arts, soon to come to Jones College.</p><p>With a dire need for skilled craftsmen and women, the new school will be a boon to the continued rebirth and growth of communities everywhere, no doubt something the Napiers feel strongly in support of and dedicated to. But the impact to the community wasn’t the only thrill on Ben’s mind. He described the moment as “an unbelievable honor” for the couple, their families and especially for their daughters.</p><p>For many, the school can’t get here fast enough. Finding skilled help in the local construction industry lately has been like finding a needle in the entire proverbial hayfield.</p><p>Local contractor Tim Middleton describes finding skilled laborers to employ as “impossible.” Middleton has been building houses for decades but says the dire need for more skilled tradesmen is the most challenging it has ever been.</p><p>“You would be hard pressed to find anyone under 40 years old today that can hang a door,” Middleton said. “And if someone can do halfway decent work, they will be snowed under.”</p><p>Learning a skilled trade has often been regarded as less desirable for young people than going to a four-year college. But that mindset is changing, especially with so many students finding out the harsh reality that student loans can be crippling for a lifetime.</p><p>“There is such an emphasis on going to college when a lot of kids don’t really know what they really want to do yet,” Cox Roofing owner Jonathan Cox said. “The mindset is that you have to go to college and earn a degree to get a high-paying job. I never went to college and my dad taught me a skill, and I’ve had my own business now for 18 years.”</p><p>Plumbers, carpenters and HVAC technicians can pretty much name their price because there are so few available.</p><p>According to Jones College, the purpose of the Napier School is to address the “workforce gap of skilled building designers, carpenters and craftspeople that are needed to restore and preserve small towns across Mississippi.” Programs will include computerized design, graphic design, interior design, painting, foundations, plumbing, framing, roofing, electrical, masonry, HVAC, carpentry, metalworking, plastering and stonework.</p><p>“Skilled labor is so rewarding,” Cox said. “The new school is so needed because it will put young people into something that they enjoy doing.”</p><p>Karly McCoy of Howard Industries said, “We are thrilled about the prospect of being able to hire new candidates who have graduated from the programs offered at the Napier School at Jones College.”</p><p>“Historically, finding skilled labor for our industry has been challenging and has grown worse in recent years,” McCoy said. “Therefore, the Napier School is meeting a definite need in our area. It will positively impact our community and companies like Howard Industries.”</p><p>Cox added, “You are going to see business owners being born out of that school. I think it is bigger than people even realize.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcLjAsqCnn12Weqe71KebmqyZpLtwrdGtoJyklZSweH3DaplrbF2ZfaaEjGponp1dboFzsIxtbm5uY2qupIPFm2lnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
