Hunt, a successful career woman, who earned her living creating advertising copy, was a woman with many male admirers. Not unexpectedly, McPhearson’s investigation focuses on the men in Laura’s life who admittedly loved her: Waldo Lydecker, her mentor; Shelby Carpenter, her fiancée; and the aspiring Julliard student, Danny Dorgan. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>But McPhearson’s investigation suddenly takes a bizarre twist when Laura Hunt enters her apartment, alive and well. And now the evidence seems to point to Laura as the killer. Who was the victim? And who was the intended target?&nbsp;Will Mark be able to solve the crime in spite of his feelings for Laura?</p><ul><li><strong>“84 Charing Cross Road”</strong> — In post-World War II New York City, struggling writer and would-be bibliophile Helene Hanff writes to the London “antiquarian” bookshop Marks & Co in search of rare titles she has not been able to find locally. Store manager Frank Doel responds politely to her chatty letter, and, over the course of two decades, a deep, long-distance friendship evolves.</li></ul><p>In a sense, these are also love letters – they are about the love of books and of good literature. Through their letters, a unique bond develops between the delightfully dusty Englishman and the brash New Yorker, who shows her gratitude through the years by sending “care packages” to the whole staff of Marks & Co.</p><p>For more details about the shows and auditions, visit the <a href=#>RHP website HERE</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJirrKNirq%2BwjJyspaylp7Jwvsicn6annpl6qbXLpWStp12WwqW106Kmp2WWpL9uusSwZKydkai8r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
