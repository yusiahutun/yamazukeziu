And now they should get ready to freak out a little more over the news that <a href=# rel=nofollow>‘This Is Us’ season 4 delivers Rebecca’s father clues</a> aplenty. As in, we’re all about to meet the second most important man in Rebecca’s life after Jack Pearson: Her father, Dave Malone. Who, honestly, we’ve known little to nothing about at this point. It begs a major question: Why was Rebecca’s father missing from the series after all these years?</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mandy-moore.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/mandymooreinterview.png><p>It’s a question that <a href=#>‘This Is Us’ creator Dan Fogelman</a> is going to need to go to lengths to answer in the fourth season. After all, viewers have already met Rebecca’s mother, Janet Malone (Elizabeth Perkins) in earlier seasons of the series. We know that Rebecca doesn’t have the best relationship with her mom, who also happens to be a lowkey racist when it comes to her black adoptive grandson, Randall…This doesn’t leave us with much to expect from her husband, Rebecca’s father, who will be played by Tim Matheson of the longstanding NBC political drama, ‘The West Wing.’</p><p>Yet actress <a href=# id=auto-tag_mandy-moore data-tag=mandy-moore>Mandy Moore</a>, who plays Rebecca Pearson in the series, has been <a href=#>teasing audiences with clues about her character’s fate</a> and relationship to her father for a few weeks now. Moore has <a href=#>mentioned in interviews this summer</a> that “Rebecca is a bit of a Daddy’s girl,” and that her father “plays a bigger role in Rebecca and Jack’s relationship moving forward.”</p><p>If this is the case, we can already start wondering what her father’s reaction to Jack was—did he approve? And if not, what did it mean for Daddy’s little girl to move in with Jack? It’s a boundary that many fathers face as their daughters grow up—and as is the situation for much of ‘This Is Us,’ audiences will be sure to empathize with this family hurdle. Let’s hope it’s a smooth one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmK6sMLInqpoaWBpg3Z%2FkGiroaGjYra0edSsZKydkai8r3mTZqmempWYsKJ5xZqroZ2iYrCtwcRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
