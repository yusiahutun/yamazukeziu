At first glance it looks likemerely another shiny ring. A closer look reveals what it actually is: a piercing on the fold between her fingers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Celebrity endorsement has once again brought body piercing under the spotlight, but this time, it is not limited to the ears, nose, tongue, lips or eyebrows. What's hot this summer are piercings in peculiar places.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tracy Yan Tsui-sze, who runs body piercing shop 3688.com in Tsim Sha Tsui's Update Mall, says more customers have asked for advice on doing a piercing similar as Cheung's. Such piercings are nothing new, she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'I first pierced people's ankles, the folds between toes and fingers, and even their armpits five years ago,' says Yan. 'People also do forearms, upper arms, their napes, and the space between collar bones. Most people didn't know about it until the media gave it exposure recently.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Body piercing goes back more than 5,000 years and has been done all over the world. It is seen as one of the most interesting ways of body modification. Yan says some people see it as body art, and they think piercings on some unusual body parts make them look pretty. Some do it, however, for the pain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'The level of pain varies according to the thickness of the needle used and the ring placed in the piercing. The piercers' experience also counts,' says Yan</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'It's true - the more painful it is, the more likely [piercing lovers] would want to do it. They enjoy the pain when the needle goes through their skin. They seek happiness through pain,' says Yan. Some also do it either to show off to their friends, or as a memento for break-ups with boyfriends, she adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yan says the bits between the fingers are not suitable for piercings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Because your hands move so much and get wet all the time, it takes much longer for the piercing to heal and is easier to get an infection,' Yan says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But dermatologist Leung Sze- kei says the bits between fingers or in the armpit are also well-suited for piercings, as long as only the skin is punctured.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He says there are basic principles along which people should follow in choosing where they want to be pierced.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'Body parts with fewer blood vessels and nerve endings, and that are not attached to muscles, are suitable for piercing,' he says, listing ear lobes as best-placed to be modified.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Frequently-used parts, like tongues and genitals, are better left untouched. 'Ankles and the fold between your toes are not suitable as you have to wear shoes. The chances of infection are much higher,' says Dr Leung.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Finding a hygienic studio to do it is a must, Dr Leung adds. '[Piercers] should use sterilised and disposable equipment, or else the chance of getting blood-transmitted diseases such as AIDS is very high,' he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">TOP FIVE WEIRD PLACES:</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">1.
