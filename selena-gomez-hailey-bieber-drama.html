You don’t have to like me, but you don’t have to say anything either because behind this person that you’re looking at on a screen is a person with a brain and a heart and emotions and issues that I face and so do you. … Just mutual respect and decency and know that what you say can have impact and know that.”</p><h2 id=september-2018-justin-and-hailey-bieber-marry>September 2018: Justin and Hailey Bieber marry</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Justin and Hailey Bieber married at a courthouse in New York City, New York, in September 2018.
