However, she recently revealed that they were in fact already a proper couple by the time they went public. The NFL player has now stolen the hearts of Taylor, the Swifties, and her dad, Scott by the looks of it, as he’s reportedly asked him one big question.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1727703664-753x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-spark-engagement-rumors-as-he-asks-dad-big-question>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift Spark engagement rumors as he ‘asks dad big question’</h2><p>Travis and Scott already have a close relationship, as they were <a href=#>spotted dancing together</a> at the Love Story star’s Buenos Aires show earlier this year.</p><p>Now, it’s been reported that he may have already asked Scott the big question, for his permission to marry his daughter.</p><p>“Scott has been asked for his blessing and has wholeheartedly given it, and Travis has been talking to friends about a ring,” a source close to Kelce <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tells</a> Page Six.</p><p>Travis’ brother Jason, has also <a href=#>shown his approval of the relationship</a>, and the source also tells the publication the 34-year-old is “the most extroverted guy Taylor has dated in forever.”</p><p>“This is so much truer to who Taylor is than any prior relationship.”</p><p>However, Swifties shouldn’t be getting their wedding gowns ready just yet, as it’s unclear whether the rumors are true.
