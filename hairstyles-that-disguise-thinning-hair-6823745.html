During the pandemic, for example, many noticed they were suffering from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stress-related hair loss</a>. Others experience <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>traction alopecia</a>, which can be caused from wearing wigs and extensions. Others have health issues that cause their hair to fall out en masse. Whatever the reason is, it can be scary to notice fewer strands on your head and more on your hair brush. Not to mention, it can cause insecurities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We firmly believe that everyone is beautiful no matter how much hair they do or don't have, but if it's something you'd like to cover up, we're here to help you do that, too. Certain hairstyles can cover up balding spots, receding hairlines, widening parts, and overall <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>thinning hair</a> — it's just a matter of knowing what to do and how to do it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To make this simpler, we tapped two experts and shared a few of the tips we've learned over the years as pros.

Next, dry bangs with a large round brush for volume and sweep them to either side," suggests Jerome Lordet, the Co-Director of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Pierre Michel Salon</a>.

Once you apply your preferred product, slick hair back into your desired position on your head with a medium to hard brush to help gather and put hair where you want it. You can twist or braid the top to create a structure knot if you want something more dynamic. Just be sure to secure it with with a hair tie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Andrew Fitzsimons</a>, celebrity hairstylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Andrew Fitzsimons Hair</a>, adds that you should a volumizing shampoo to start like his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Andrew Fitzsimons Body Volume Shampoo and Conditioner</a> and then secure with hair with pins to really lock it in place. For something a bit more casual, he says to leave out the ends to help hair look fuller.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-flipped-over-side-part></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Flipped Over Side Part</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jason Merritt/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Especially if your hair is thinning at the top of your head, Celebrity Hairstylist & Dyson Global Styling Ambassador <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Matt Collins</a> says it is best to avoid having a center part. To get a deep side part, he says to start by spraying a generous amount of volumizing tonic. You’ll want to blowdry hair while your hair is flipped upside down to give it some volume. You can style hair while it’s still parted at the center. Then once you’re done, flip your hair over to the side, one to two inches from the center. He says this will push your roots in the opposite direction from which they were set and give your full body.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-caesar-cut></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Caesar Cut</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gregg DeGuire/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Caesar cut (or flat wrap) is just a super short cut with slight bangs out front. James suggests this hairstyle to help disguise hair loss as you can create comb over any receding area. Style and mold hair with either a mousse or gel.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blunt-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Blunt Bob</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram @haileybieber</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The shorter and blunter your hair is, the fuller it will appear, Collins says. “If your experiencing hair loss chances are there is already texture in your hair, so there is no need to add this,” he says. “Just go for as blunt as possible.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He says you can add texturing by styling it with natural-looking waves or by adding a texture spray. He adds that the shorter the strands, the more you are able to achieve volume when air drying. If you really want to add some body, he says to start with a good mousse on your roots before drying your hair.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-twist-outs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Twist-Outs</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Araya Doheny/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Twist-outs</a> are a great option to hide hair loss if you’ve got natural curls. To do this, James says to split hair into about eight to ten sections. Working section by section, apply a generous curling pomade before twisting your curls. Leave it to dry and once dry, undo and style as desired. He says this style works best on hair longer than four inches and can be used to create volume when the twist is separated.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can also opt for flat twists, where you’re twisting curls in the same motion as twists just grabbing them to lay them flat. James says to part hair in the direction which will cover the area hair loss. You’ll then want to flat twist — or cornrow — curls. Leave it dry and then you can undo and style as desired.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-face-framing-layers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Face-Framing Layers</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>John Shearer/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Collins says that the most common hair loss is often around the front of the hairline and temples. For that reason, soft face framing layers will make any sparse area seem purposeful. He suggests styling hair with a soft wavy texture to create the illusion of volume. He says to use something like the<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Dyson Cordless Corrale Straightner</a> to give hair that soft bend, taking large sections and bending from the root to mid-shaft slowly. Then pull the iron through the hair quicker once you reach the ends.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-back-combed-ponytail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Back-Combed Ponytail</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>David Livingston/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hair loss generally pops up around the crown area for women <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>experiencing alopecia</a>, which Collins says makes it an easy spot cover. Simply style hair with a curl tonic, curl enhancing mousse, or light hold gel before letting hair dry (naturally or with the help with a dryer and diffuser to enhance texture for coarse hair). Then sweep hair into a backcombed pony (or bun) with a slight pouf at the top to hide any signs of hair loss.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-curly-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Curly Bob</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram @<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>lauraharrier</a></p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve got long natural curls and are experiencing hair along the hairline receding or looking damaged, Collins recommends a big change and chopping hair into a full heavy curly fringe and blont bob above the shoulders. To style, use your normal styling products for curls and grab a diffuser to give your curls volume.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq6ukrrmmv4ytn5qsXZm2tLPUoqqeZaSdtq%2B6yKeeZqCRnr9ugpdranBsZQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
