My six-year-old Paperwhite is still going strong. You're pretty likely to still have a working Kindle if you upgrade to a newer model, so here's what you need to do before selling or giving away your old one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=deregister-it-from-your-account>Deregister It From Your Account</h2><p>Your Kindle is connected seamlessly to your Amazon account. You almost never need to enter your password or confirm your credit card details to buy a book. This is great when you're the only person using your Kindle, but if you're planning to give it to someone else, you don't want them to have free reign on your bank account.</p><p>On the Kindle, go to Menu > Settings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1menusettings.png><p>Next, head to My Account > Deregister Device.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/3deretister.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the confirmation window that pops up, tap "Deregister" again and the Kindle will be disconnected from your Amazon account.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1menusettings.png><p>Now it's ready for someone else to set up.</p><h2 id=reset-the-kindle-optional>Reset the Kindle (Optional)</h2><p>This step is technically optional, but it's a good idea to reset your Kindle to its factory settings before selling it or giving it away. The new owner will be able to start from a totally blank slate.</p><p>Go to Menu > Settings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1menusettings.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the Settings page, tap the Menu button again, and then select the "Reset" option.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/6swappa.png><p>In the confirmation window, tap "Yes" and the Kindle will take a few minutes to restart and reset. Once it's finished, the Kindle will be like it was on the day you got it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 id=clean-the-kindle>Clean the Kindle</h2><p>Let's be honest, people are filthy, filthy creatures. Any personal device you've had for more than a few weeks is smothered in bacteria. Something like a Kindle that you've had for years and used everywhere in your house is practically a petri dish. Before giving away or selling your Kindle, do the decent thing and give it a good cleaning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Kindles are almost all screen, grab some <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">screen cleaning wipes</a> and give your Kindle a good wipe down. Don't use household cleaning products or rubbing alcohol, as they could damage the device. It's much the same process as <a href=#>cleaning your phone</a> (which you should also be doing).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How (and Why) You Should Be Cleaning Your Phone and Other Electronics</a></span></p><h2 id=selling-or-giving-away-your-kindle>Selling or Giving Away Your Kindle</h2><p>With your Kindle clean on the inside and out, it's time to get it in the hands of another loving owner. There are lots of options for where you can sell your Kindle, but one of the old reliables like <a href=#>Craigslist, Amazon, eBay, or Swappa</a> is going to give you the best results.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Should I Sell My Stuff? eBay vs. Craigslist vs. Amazon</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, since Kindles are pretty cheap to begin with, you probably aren't going to get a lot of money for an older, used model. A brand new <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite</a> retails for $119.99 on Amazon. Someone is listing one for $105 on Swappa but the most recent sale was for $85. Used, older, or cheaper Kindles are going to sell for less.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Personally, I prefer to hand my old Kindles on to someone I know who loves to read, but doesn't have one yet. Books have always been my favorite gifts and a Kindle is the closest digital equivalent.</p><p>If you're passing your Kindle on to a family member, you should <a href=#>set up Amazon Household</a>. This way you both keep your own Amazon accounts but you're able to share any Kindle purchases either of you make. There are also children's profiles available, so you can control what your kids are able to read; you don't want them left with unfettered access to Amazon's copious amount of bad literotica.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Set Up Amazon Household to Share Amazon Prime (and More)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kindles, since they're so simple, can easily last for years. Most people I know end upgrading their Kindle before it breaks just to get the latest features. This makes them perfect for giving away or selling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhqbm9obYVwtM6wZK2nXaiyrbiMqKlmn5mrsm6t1pqwZrGfqr9ut8inm6WdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
