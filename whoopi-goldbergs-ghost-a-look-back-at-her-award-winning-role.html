The actress would star alongside&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Patrick Swayze</strong></a> in the film — in fact, her costar was so adamant about working with Whoopi that he threatened to bail on the movie if she wasn’t hired.</p><p>“(Patrick) got hired to do ‘Ghost’ and asked them, ‘Why hasn’t Whoopi Goldberg? Have you talked to her?’” the Hollywood star recalled on ITV’s&nbsp;Loose Women. “And they were like, ‘No, no. We didn’t go to her’. He said, ‘No, no I’m not committing to this until I talk to her to see if she wants to do this movie.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/whoopi-goldberg-on-ghost-2.jpg><p>Eventually, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirty Dancing</a>&nbsp;star got what he wanted. “So day comes and I go and (Patrick) says, ‘Why don’t you want to do this movie?’ And I said, ‘Wait, aren’t you Patrick Swayze?’ And he says, ‘Yes’, and I said, ‘What makes you think I don’t want to do the movie? I’d love to do the movie, they said they didn’t want me,” Whoopi continued.</p><p>Whoopi added, “So he said, ‘If you’re not going to hire her, I am not going to be in this film’. …&nbsp;And then I got the Oscar for it.”</p><p>“We had a a lot of fun,” the&nbsp;Sister Act&nbsp;star told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Access Hollywood</a> of being on set with Patrick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Whoopi-Goldberg-on-ghosts-3.jpg><p>Patrick wasn’t the only ’90s heavyweight that Whoopi starred alongside —&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Demi Moore</strong></a> also played a role, adding to her already successful film resume at the time. The movie not only would go on to become the highest-grossing film of 1990, it would leave plenty of iconic scenes and quotes in our minds for years — including Whoopi’s iconic, “Molly, you in danger girl.”</p><p>Whoopi even found herself <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recreating the classic scene</a> during an appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch What Happens Live</a>. She of course said her memorable line — a quote that has become a meme, even decades after Whoopi first uttered it. However, in 2018, when it was said to her during a press junket, the star didn’t exactly recall it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/whoopi-goldbergs-ghost-performance.jpg><p>“Oh, it was 35 years ago, I don’t watch my own movies,” Whoopi said according to&nbsp;<strong>Amber Riley</strong>. Well, we certainly remember it, and will never forget Whoopi’s most memorable performance!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6inoJ56qLvLnZmeqpeoeqi0zqyrZpldobywt4ybmJyjXZbBbrTEq2Sar5GnsW7DyKeloqaXYr%2BwuMRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
