The couple married not long after they met backstage at one of the band's performances.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On their wedding day, April 11, 1981, the 21-year-old bride spent part of the celebration, 'holding her husband's head over a toilet bowl, pulling his hair back to make sure it didn't become encrusted with vomit'. Van Halen, then 25, vowed to do better but that didn't happen, according to&nbsp;Runnin' with the Devil.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Contrary to her public image, Bertinelli was also using cocaine at one point and that it helped to control her weight, saying: 'Ed likes me skinny.'
