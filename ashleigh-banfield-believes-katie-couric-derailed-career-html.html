It broke my heart. It broke my soul,' she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As for the line in Couric's memoir where she alludes that mentoring Banfield 'sometimes felt like self-sabotage,' Banfield 'really wondered if this is it'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She added: 'It's really hard to process this, I'm not gonna lie, because I have found the most joy in my career having women - and men - look up to me and ask for advice.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I kinda get a charge out of it thinking I'm an elder statesman and that I could be that resource for people and I have loved doing it... And I've never felt that it derailed me in any way. The opposite - I got that all back. That investment has always come back to me. So the fact that it might not have happened for me, it's a bit heartbreaking.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So, according to Couric's memoir, while the rumors from more than two decades ago may be true, Banfield doesn't seem to hold a grudge, and attributed Couric's jealousy to competitiveness between women in the TV industry.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'll also say this - it's not easy for women,' Banfield told TMZ. 'And in the 90s it stank. We always felt like we were on the edge of being trashed and cast aside.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Ageism for women was so palpable (that) I felt in my thirties that I needed Botox.
