Over 260 days #sugarfree … can’t begin to describe how #amazing I feel,” she captioned the image. In the full-length mirror selfie, a slim and smiling Shepherd wears a pair of black Guess over-the-knee boots on top of a pair of camouflage jeans from Centerstage Boutique. She also sported an “I Am a CEO Chick” tank top.</p><p>Just as much as the <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a>, the former View host, 51, is enjoying the other health benefits of going sugar free. “Energy, clarity of thought and mind. Focused … patient w my son. Hearing from God a lot more clearly. Present,” she continued in her caption. “I’ve done this slowly and steadily and since March I’ve come down over 25lbs. This is not a fad- it’s my life that is at stake. It feels so good to feel #good”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shepherd also revealed that she relied on a keto diet lifestyle, a <a href=# rel=noopener>popular celebrity diet</a> choice, to accomplish her goal, including the hashtags #ketodiva and #ketogenic in her post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sherri-Shepherd-2.jpg><p>The actress has been open about her weight struggles in the past, and tracked her progress on her Instagram, <a href=# rel=noopener>@sherrieshepherd</a>, over the course of 2018. In a July interview on The Wendy Williams Show, Shepherd credited her son Jeffrey for inspiring her health journey. “Sometimes you go through stuff and you want to just grab something sweet,” she said. “Ex-husbands, things like that. And I was doing that and Jeffrey was in the backseat, Wendy, and I was eating something I wasn’t supposed to. He said, ‘Mommy, if you die, who’s going to be my bodyguard?’ I said, ‘What are you talking about?’ ‘Who’s going to watch me?’ And literally I said, ‘Sherri, you’ve got to do something different.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGasoJWnv6p50qGcqaCVp7FusNGop6xlYmp6ra7SZpifrJWneqa4yKagp5mknruoedKunpqqXaS7brfEraZmnJmawXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
