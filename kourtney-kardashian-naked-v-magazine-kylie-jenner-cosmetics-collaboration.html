One night when we were at our mom's house, she had mentioned she had some ideas about a possible collab. We were actually going to do to it last year, but then we decided to change direction," Kourtney explained. "At the time, it was going to be just lips and we were going back and forth about the packaging, and for both of us in the moment, it didn't feel fully right. So Kylie then was cool about pushing it to this year and we took the time to both think about what we wanted, and then came together with our ideas. We ended up creating something totally different from what we were talking about before. We decided to do three eyeshadow palettes and a lip to go with each palette. And then came the packaging, which is also completely different from what we originally imagined last year."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:933ff74d-a3b6-5c4e-8237-5490f1e00a20 data-container-ref=toofab:article:005526a9-ffc4-5083-9547-2caabda5c3a4 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/90/5by4/2018/04/11/9002c3ddb02b5c03aea357a0c1b63b3c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">17 Brutal Memes to Emerge Since Tristan Thompson Was Caught Cheating on Khloe Kardashian</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Kourt says her recent trip to Japan with her sisters Kim and Khloe helped spark some new ideas.</p><p>"With the red color, I was very inspired by geishas because we had just been in Japan and all of the geishas we had met had red eyeshadow. And with everything else, there is a big range of different options," she said. "It was definitely a true collaboration between the two of us from the start of creating this collection. Kylie would say her vision for this collection and then I would chime in with my ideas, and then after we came up with the products, it was easy to tweak here and there without any tension. In the end, we would both agree on everything."</p><p>Though Kourtney acknowledges she tends to rock the most natural makeup compared to her sisters, "I love when I have the opportunity to play with makeup and have fun with it. I think this shoot, using my collab with Kylie, was the perfect situation to try some new stuff."</p><p>"I've lately been in a mood to try more things with makeup and hair, and I personally have even more fun with it when I have a reason," she added.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fc/o/2018/04/20/fc7208f7bd4452e1a0cf131b303d36b8_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Greg Swales</span> <a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ca/o/2018/04/18/cab7010985b35c8eb1448dad40e36543_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnl7j21ma2hfoLy2vtOnnLJlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapl2jrqyxw2atZqWRnK67tc2eZKSxnJ6ybrbEp6Weql2YvLS5xK2gnKtdmLytuMCbpquZpJ68r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
