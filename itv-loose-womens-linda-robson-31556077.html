And at the end of the dinner all of the car keys went into the middle of the table."</p><p>The panel all fell about laughing with Frank Lampard's wife Christine appearing to be horrified as Denise asked: "Who did you get?" Swerving the question, Linda tactfully told her co-stars that Mark made up an excuse that "his brothers Rottweiler had got loose and was ripping up the furniture," with the TV star hilariously adding "your brother hasn't got a Rottweiler," in front of those who were sat at the table.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31495825.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_solm.jpg><p>A few weeks back, the Birds Of A Feather star left <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>ITV</a> viewers a-gasp as she appeared to confirm her 33-year marriage to husband Mark Dunford was done with. However, on today's show she wasn't giving anything away as she continued to refer to him as "my husband".</p><p>In September, Linda was discussing matters of the heart on the ITV show alongside co-stars Brenda Edwards, Jane Moore and Denise Welch. But was captivated most attention was her explosive confession.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Jane turned to her co-star asking how things had been at the moment with her love life. Much to everyones surprise, the actress blurted out that she "not looking for anyone" before explaining she "can't be f****".</p><p>Linda went on during the same episode: "I've had two loves of my life and now my grandchildren are the love of my life and my children. So no I’m not looking for anyone." Brenda commented: "You’re not looking, you’re not actively looking…"</p><p>“No, I can’t be f**** any more," Linda responded bluntly. Leaving Jane to swiftly step in to offer up apologies for Linda's language as co-stars and audience members remained stunned over her admission.</p><p><b><i>For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking</i> </b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b><i>here</i></b></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKymZLa1woylpqirlWLEsLnEp6pmpJmjsaJ50aiZrKeeYoBygZRvZ3Bv</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
