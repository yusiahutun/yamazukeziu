Offering diners a selection of premium ribs, steaks, handmade burgers, amazing desserts and generous portions, it quickly won a reputation for high-quality food and a relaxed environment, making it the perfect place for regular get-togethers and one-of-a-kind celebrations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One initial advantage, no doubt, was Hongkongers’ evident love of US-themed eateries and the “star-spangled platter”. OpenRice, the respected food and restaurant guide website, shows the city now has a stunning 1,070 American-style restaurants. But to succeed, each one must find its niche, understand the market, and show it can move with the times.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ruby Tuesday was originally established back in 1972 and, with its corporate headquarters in Tennessee, now owns, operates and franchises restaurants around the world. Its guiding aim is to give customers everywhere a unique American-style culinary experience, which ensures they will keep coming back for more.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Asia Pacific RT (Hong Kong), the local franchise owner, opened its first restaurant in 1995 and, in doing so, also made Hong Kong the company’s first international market.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That presence has steadily expanded, with eight branches now operating in the city and two more on the way. As a result, the brand is widely recognised as one of the city’s best American bar-and-grill restaurants and a magnet for locals and tourists alike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/11/24/9ff5506a-c0d5-47d3-a13c-1730497bd0a4_eaac45f9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is a constant demand for high-quality food and novel dining experiences, which is precisely why Hong Kong was the initial overseas market for Ruby Tuesday, and why it is a crucial location for us,” Leslie Bailey, managing director of Asia Pacific RT (Hong Kong), says. “It offers a low and simple tax regime and enables 100 per cent foreign ownership.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also highlighted other strengths of the city’s business ecosystem, in particular citing examples of how advice and help are easy to find for anyone looking to launch a new venture. This makes everything clear and straightforward, removing potential obstacles and encouraging investment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Moreover, the rule of law is one of the key strengths that serve as the foundation of Hong Kong’s success as a prominent international commercial and financial centre,” Bailey says. “This provides a secure setting for individuals and businesses to operate in.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When such a platform exists, companies can also start to think about the options for further expansion and how best to capitalise on opportunities for growth within the region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ruby Tuesday continues to do just that, and its plans go hand in hand with initiatives to keep enhancing its overall dining experience, for instance through the adoption of new technology, such as a customer-centric mobile app.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That is just one element of what the company calls a “journey of reimagination”, which aims to improve every aspect of the operation – from sourcing ingredients to marketing and restaurant design.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have made significant investments in technology, introducing a fully integrated point-of-sale system, which enables us to efficiently manage customer data and menus,” Bailey says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have also upgraded our human resources system by participating in the government’s Technology Voucher Programme [which subsidises local businesses on the use of technological services and solutions to improve productivity].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The combined effect of these and other measures has made it possible to improve production capacity, enhance engagement with customers, offer excellent value, and deliver an unmatched dining experience featuring authentic American cuisine.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also, by making the most of Hong Kong’s inbuilt advantages, the company has been able to keep moving forward, adding locations and setting new targets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a regional hub, the city has always been a gateway between mainland China and the rest of the world,” Bailey says. “We are always optimistic about the local market and have doubled the number of Ruby Tuesday restaurants in the city since 2019.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Already well advanced, the next planned step is to open a new outlet within the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP) complex near Tai Po by the end of this year. After that, another outlet is slated to open at Lucky Plaza in Sha Tin during next year’s first quarter.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are actively searching for new restaurant locations in Hong Kong and the wider region to expand our footprint,” Bailey says, noting that InvestHK has been a valuable partner in the company’s growth journey.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They play a vital role in identifying opportunities and sharing them with us, making it easier to expand our business.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvbOx0p6lrZ2UZK%2B2v8innKyrX6m8sbXCrGabrZmhsaq6xmaZrquZo7K0v4yhpqefXaC8r7OOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkW1pb25iZLWww4yipa%2Bdo6m1rHnHmqpmp6Cau6awjJ2mqKqjYq6usdGimpqmXZeus3nAp5tmn6Keua150Z6qrZmlp66vwIycn5qhnmK%2Ftq7YZquunaOZrro%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
