They made 14 stops as they circled the church grounds, reciting scripture and singing hymns.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among the participants was retired civil servant Henry Lai, 69, who was not wearing a mask as he recited passages from the Bible in front of the assembly at the first stop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our event only takes place on the premises rather than marching onto the streets, so there are not many restrictions on it,” said Lai, who became a Christian three years ago. “It is great that we can finally resume this important tradition after the pandemic.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong protests: 7 religious marches approved by police for Good Friday</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The processions are an annual tradition for many local churches, but they could not hold them over the past three years due to social-distancing rules enacted during the pandemic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clerk Helen Shiu Lai-fong, 56, joined the procession with her husband and son. She urged the government to lift all the curbs on public processions, which she described as a restriction of her freedom to practise her religion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They are not necessary. We join these religious events peacefully and legally,” Shui, who has been a Christian for five years, said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Retired couple Pamela Chan, 61, and Wan Chung, 65, who also took part in the procession, made a similar call.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong security chief defends new measures to identify rally participants</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think there is no need for the restrictions as we are doing this with the utmost sincerity so nothing illegal will happen,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The restrictions on Friday’s processions were less severe than ones imposed on a protest over a reclamation plan in Tseung Kwan O last month – the first authorised rally since Covid-19 emerged in early 2020. Dozens of participants were required to wear numbered lanyards and were cordoned off from the public.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Among other religious marches held across the city, one held on The Peak required worshippers to wear labels with the name of the church, according to police.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the force’s letters of no objection, all the organisers of the seven processions had to ensure they were in compliance with the laws of Hong Kong, including the one on national security. In the wake of the anti-government protests in 2019, authorities banned face coverings at demonstrations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The total number of participants that organisers pre-registered with the police was up to 430 in all seven marches on Friday, and 59 marshals were needed to ensure public order during the processions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoqqibmZrBunvAq6uim5yafHR%2BkG9qbHFfbHqou86dZJ%2BqmZmuunnRnqOin5mkwrR5zJqpnKCVqHqpscudZJqboqTAtHnHqKWgZZuku6h5zKiqrWWdmrqjsdGsZK2nnJl6rLHEqWSfmZOawG7CyKygm6SV</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
