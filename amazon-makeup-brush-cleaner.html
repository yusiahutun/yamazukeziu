Though we should wash them regularly, we’re completely guilty of being too lazy at times because it can be such a time-consuming and tedious chore. However, we found an electric makeup brush cleaner that doesn’t require literally any time or effort.</span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Luxe’s Electric Makeup Brush Cleaner</span></a><span> is the handiest little machine that washes (and dries!!) your brushes for you in mere minutes. You could easily pop your faves in there right before starting your makeup routine in the morning or at the end of the day while you’re unwinding. You could even do it while applying makeup to streamline both processes.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DVFxtargetreview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/best-clothing-sales-right-now-winter.png><p><span>The last thing you want is to keep using your dirty brushes, which can potentially lead to skin irritation or breakouts. Cleaning your brushes is more than a routine good hygiene practice. It impacts the state of your skin and whether it stays clear and healthy.</span></p><p><span>“I absolutely adore this machine, it’s just too convenient!” wrote one shopper who gave the product a five-star rating. “I will never wash my brush by hand again because this machine takes everything out, and it always looks and </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>feels like a brand new makeup brush</span></a><span>!”</span></p><p><span>Not only does the small device wash your brushes, it also dries them quickly. Waiting for brushes to dry can be such a turn off to cleaning them in the first place, but this </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>electric brush cleaner</span></a><span> does both in minutes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>RELATED: </b><a href=# rel=noopener><b>These Automatic Makeup Brush Cleaners Are Major Game-Changers For Beauty Lovers</b></a><b>&nbsp;</b></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/luxe-electric-makeup-brush-cleaner-amazon.png><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Luxe Electric Makeup Brush Cleaner</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$27.99</span></p><p><span>First, let’s break down what’s included: You get a brush spinner, a brush cleaner dock, eight brush collars, a break-resistant cleaning bowl, a charger and a user guide all with a single purchase.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Start by pouring soap and water into the bowl. Then, slide your brush into the collar that fits best and spinner head, drop it into the bowl and press it against the bottom of the bowl. Choose your desired spinning speed and let the machine do it’s thing. Once your brush is clean, keep it spinning and lift it above the liquid in the bowl so it can dry.</span></p><p><span>It’s that easy. Plus, the motor is designed to be </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>gentle on your brushes</span></a><span> so that the bristles don’t get wrecked while spinning in the machine. Just make sure you clean the bowl and lid regularly to avoid product build up.</span></p><p><span>“It is super easy to use, </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>cleans the brushes</span></a><span> and dries them to perfection,” wrote another reviewer. “I cleaned all my brushes in a matter of minutes and they will be ready to use in no time. No more excuses of not having enough time to dry them before I need them again.”</span></p><p><span>For brushes that continuously look brand new, along with no more unexpected breakouts or rashes, take </span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"><span>Luxe’s Electric Brush Cleaner</span></a><span> for a spin. Better skin for $28 sounds like such a steal to us.</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter-beauty_july2020.jpg alt="STYLECASTER | Ashley Benson Interview" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpYmqDc32PaJimmaqku265wKScrqhdl7%2B2v8dmmqWdkaOys3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
