One would have a tough time arguing there was a bigger song in 2013 — Rucker has the Grammy to prove it.</p><p>While the OCMS hit was an underground success, Rucker's version with <a href=#>Lady Antebellum</a> brought the nation's focus to this brand of old-timey music once again, just as the Soggy Bottom Boys did with <a href=#>Song No. 21</a> on this&nbsp;<a href=#>Top Country Songs of the Century</a>&nbsp;list.&nbsp;<a href=#>Granger Smith</a> paid tribute to this song when we caught up with him recently.&nbsp;He shares producers with&nbsp;Rucker and learned that Rucker had not heard the song until he was at his kid's talent show.</p><p>"His kids junior talent show," Smith explains. "He calls Frank (Rogers) mid-performance and goes, 'There's this song called 'Wagon Wheel.' You won't believe it.'"</p><p>Smith says he relates to the song because like him, it went from an indie hit to a mainstream smash. "Wagon Wheel" was a multi-week No. 1 and has become Rucker's&nbsp;career hit as a country artist.</p><p><strong>About this list</strong>: Taste of Country’s <a href=#>Top Country Songs of the Century</a> were decided by a panel of country music experts and fans using sales and chart data, a song’s social and musical impact and lyrical integrity. Select artists were also surveyed. You’ll hear from several throughout the list.</p><p><strong>Granger Smith Reflects on&nbsp;the Importance of "Wagon Wheel"&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmnZminsK0edGumqSdomLEorPOp2SwoJWauW7AzqlkrKeenMBuu8Vmq6GdXZiyr8DUq7Bo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
