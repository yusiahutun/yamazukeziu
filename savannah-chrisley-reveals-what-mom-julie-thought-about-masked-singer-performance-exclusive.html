"And that just solidified the decision that I made that it was the right decision, because hearing her laugh is worth everything in this entire laugh."</p><p>Fans of the Chrisley family will know that both Julie and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Todd Chrisley</strong></a>,<strong> </strong>are spending time in separate states and prisons after their convictions for bank and tax fraud, surrendering themselves in January 2023. Todd is serving a reduced 10-year sentence in Pensacola, Florida, while Julie's reduced five-year stint is in Lexington, Kentucky.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/16by9/2024/03/14/b698228420014e1a8cb8d61e71976004_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>She continued, "So the fact that it gave her a laugh made it all worth it."</p><p>While The Chrisley Knows Best alum said she doesn't think her dad was able to catch it, she did say that he's well aware that she "can't sing."</p><p>"He knows though, I cannot sing," Savannah quipped. "He knows."</p><p>That didn't stop Savannah from embracing her time on stage, with the 26-year-old telling TooFab that her goal was to get out of her comfort zone and to show her younger siblings, Grayson, 17, and Chloe, 11, that they can too.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f0ab230f-1547-4225-8d94-48d0f5e576cb data-container-ref=toofab:article:93b30b37-4a32-4238-9b3e-3d328f1fbaf2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/31/5by4/2024/03/14/31b35c149d6d43d8a9a5347bc2c879c5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Masked Singer Madness: Quite Possibly the Worst Singer Ever on This Show Takes the Stage</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"First off, I wanted to show my brother and sister that it doesn't matter how hard life gets, get up and keep pushing forward," she said. "Go outside of your comfort zone. You don't have to be so hard on yourself. You don't have to be perfect at everything. Go out and laugh at yourself, because if you can laugh at yourself, then there is never a time to where someone can make you feel bad about yourself by laughing at you."</p><p>Savannah continued, "So I just really wanted them to see that you don't have to take life so serious. Go out and have fun."</p><p>As for what she learned, Savannah, who was left in charge of her younger siblings amid her parents' stint behind bars, said being able to laugh at herself was just what she needed during what's been an otherwise difficult time for her family.</p><p>"I think I was finally able to teach myself that like, 'Hey, you can be uncomfortable and you can laugh at yourself, and you don't have to be so uptight sometimes,' so it was a good reprieve," she shared.</p><p>While she acknowledged that she isn't much of a singer, her decision to go out and just laugh and have fun with it proved to be entertaining, with Savannah even making herself giggle at one point in the performance.</p><p>"Coming to the realization that, 'Hey, you can't sing, so you might as well just make people laugh,' so that's what I did," Savannah said. "And just knowing that my parents were going to be able to watch it and just laugh at it with me, that made it all worth it."</p><p>While she called her Masked Singer experience a "one and done," Savannah isn't shying away from other reality competition shows, including Survivor and even a run on Dancing With the Stars.</p><p>"This is my 'yes' year, or years of my life, where I just want to say 'yes' and experience so many different things," Savannah declared.</p><p>The Masked Singer introduces Group C next Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET on Fox.</p><a id=gallery-link-9a1c7ae7-20d5-5914-978d-63d89bcd954b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9a1c7ae7-20d5-5914-978d-63d89bcd954b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:93b30b37-4a32-4238-9b3e-3d328f1fbaf2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0f/4by3/2019/02/20/0f7527e82edf5b219e2506fd8ee306f3_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2xmamxfqK63rc2nmKFlk52%2Fqr%2FLnrBmqpWrsqK40mauoZmkYrqwuYyjrKWhlWLBqbvUoJ%2BtZZGXvLbAjKaYrKOVmXq0tc2gnKtloJq%2Fp7vRppinm5Visrmvy66qoq6VZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
