Despite their 23-year age gap, the couple fell hard for each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“Safe to say the best part of 2021 was meeting the most incredible man,” Aubrey gushed in a New Year’s Eve Instagram post, adding, “Wishing everyone love, happiness, safety and health in 2022.”</p><p>Six months later, the pair was spending the summer in the Hamptons, where they shared their love of cooking. “Hello and welcome to our test kitchen … where two people obsessed with food try to teach other how to cook. A great weekend always involves cooking with a view. Happy Sunday!! [sic]” the Delaware native wrote next to a photo of the lovebirds cuddled up on their patio followed by a series of snapshots of the meal they were making. <span class=ContentPasted2>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/296192856_3153308101651266_7696967396039893606_n.jpg><h2>Are Ryan Seacrest and Aubrey Paige Still Together?</h2><p>Aubrey shared an Instagram video <a href=#>filled with cozy photos</a> of the couple on February 14, 2023. “Happy Valentine’s Day mi amor, ” Aubrey wrote to Ryan. “Loving you has been the adventure of a lifetime.

The pair dated from 2010 through 2013. “Every relationship, there was nothing wrong or bad, but there was nothing right,” she told Redbook in 2014 following their split. “I had one foot out because I didn’t want to get hurt. And I didn’t say what was on my mind because I didn’t want to ruffle any feathers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46aqZ5loq6ur3nSnpicqpWowW6t1JupnrFdpa6qs8Rmp56sk6TArMWMrKuipJxiwbCzxK2fnqpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
