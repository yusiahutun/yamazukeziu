Thank you 🥺” Lizzo tweeted in April.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-setlist.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-tickets.jpg><p>In an interview with Los Angeles radio station 104.3 MYfm in April 2022, Lizzo explained why she chose Latto as her opening act and teased what her tour will look like.&nbsp;“I’m so excited because I’ve been a fan of Latto for a long time and now I’m so excited to go on with her!” she said. “It’s gonna be lit!” Lizzo also hinted that some of the dancers from her Amazon Prime Video series, Watch Out For the Big Grrrls, could join her on tour after she used four of them on Saturday Night Live in April 2022. “That felt good… I was like, ‘Yeah, let’s keep this up!’” she said.</p><p>Despite her love touring, <a href=# rel=noopener>Lizzo</a> also told “The Angie Martinez Show” in April 2022 about how it can hard for her to enjoy her free time while she’s on the road.&nbsp;“The intimacy of autonomy.. you lose that,” Lizzo said. “I don’t think people even realize it because everyone has it. So i think losing that.. there were little things like when we would go on tour, we would be in different cities and my and my friends or my glam team and the dancers would go try different restaurants. And it would be like ‘Ok let’s just walk down here’ and it’s like ‘Ok cool meet you in the lobby in 15’. I couldn’t do that anymore because first I had to tell security and then security had to call a car and then we had to call the restaurant in advance and make special reservations and it was like two hours of our time and I was like ‘Just go without me y’all.’ It’s like I’m a burden to my friends.”</p><p>Back to <a href=# rel=noopener>Lizzo</a> tickets.

However, it’s assumed that the set list will mostly include songs from Lizzo’s fourth studio album, Special, which will be released on July 15, 2022, and consists of 12 songs, including her lead single, “About Damn Time” and title track, “Special.” In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple <a href=# id=auto-tag_music-2 data-tag=music-2>Music</a> 1 in April 2022, Lizzo explained that the album was originally In Case Nobody Told You&nbsp;until music producer Max Martin helped her “restructure” the hook of the song “Special,” which Lizzo changed her album title to.</p><p>“Special is multipurposeful, and can mean so many things,” she said. “Specifically, I wrote a song on the album. It’s called Special, so it’s named after… It’s the titular song. The album was called In Case Nobody Told You for a while, and then Max Martin came on and he helped me change the hook a little bit and restructured it. He was like, ‘Special, Special. The song is Special.’ I was like, ‘Okay.'”</p><p>She continued, “Then one day, I had this aha moment where I’m like, ‘Oh shit, the album is Special. Literally, the album is special, and I’m special.’ You know what I’m saying? I want the person to hear this to feel special. The way that you feel when you say that word is like… In Case Nobody Told You is cool, it has that same kind of dark… Everything now has this special feel to it, and this glow, this sparkle. Ever since that’s the era I’m moving into. It’s out of the darkness and into the light. I feel like the album is an incredible body of music, which was super important to me. I wanted to create good fucking music that actually was cohesive, and meaningful, and rich and lush, and I think people is… It could be a grower, it could be a shower. I don’t care, it’s good. Once people discover it, it’s going to make them feel good and them know what’s up.”</p><h2>Who are Lizzo’s The Special Tour opening acts?</h2><p>Lizzo’s The Special Tour opening act is Latto, who is scheduled to perform at all 23 dates. Latto is a rapper who is best known for her song “Big Energy” from her 2021 album, 777.
