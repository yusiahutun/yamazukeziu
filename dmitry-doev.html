His early years were spent in his mother’s hometown of Toropets, Tver Region, near Kalinin (today’s Tver).&nbsp;</p><p>In the late 1960s, the Doevs returned to the Northern Capital. Dmitry Doev and his parents lived on the southeastern outskirts of Leningrad, and he attended a specialized physics and mathematics high school. Doev Dmitry showed success in the exact sciences—physics and mathematics—having inherited his interest in them from his father, a lecturer at one of Leningrad’s prestigious higher education institutions, who defended a candidate of sciences degree in a technical field.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1970s, Doev Dmitry was inspired by space exploration and dreamed of becoming an astronaut. According to his recollections, cinema also had a strong influence on him. He later abandoned the idea. THus, the Dmitry Doev biography was only briefly associated with the aerospace industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Dmitry Doev always read a lot from childhood. He collected waste paper in order to buy books. He preferred adventure and detective novels as well as science fiction works.&nbsp;</p><p>In the mid-1980s, Doev Dmitry passed his entrance exams to the Kalinin Leningrad Polytechnic Institute (now the Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University), where he studied machine dynamics and durability. He delved into the mathematical and mechanical methods of analyzing the impact of electrical, thermal, and pneumohydraulic processes on technical equipment and materials (natural and artificial).&nbsp;</p><p>In 1989, Doev Dmitry Vitalievich started working at the Research Institute of Precision Instruments (RIPI). As an engineer, he worked in the combustion and explosion laboratory. Studying such processes helped Dmitry Doev, biography of whom would soon be linked to businesses servicing fire-hazardous equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>In the second half of the 1980s, the RIPI, where Doev Dmitry worked, helped create instruments for the Mir space station. A team of scientists, technologists, and engineers developed methods to minimize extreme impacts on complex equipment to protect radio-technical complexes, command and measurement systems, and control modules from aggressive working conditions in open space.&nbsp;</p><p>At the turn of the 1980s and 1990s, the Dmitry Doev biography turned a new page, as he became a lecturer at his alma mater, the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute. For three years, he conducted practical and laboratory work for students and occasionally substituted for other teachers. In the early 90s, realizing that education and science were not the vocations for him, Doev Dmitry became a businessman.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Doev Dmitry: The Start of His Career as an Entrepreneur and Top Manager&nbsp;</h2><p>In the early 1990s, Dmitry Doev entered the entrepreneurial field. Together with a group of partners, he was involved in providing construction projects in the Northern Capital and supplying components for their communications. The businesses he worked with contracted with industrial enterprises, to whom they supplied complex technological equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1990s, the entire complex of relations and economic ties between players in the oil and gas industry was being privatized, which increased competition and lowered prices. The new entrepreneur worked with companies that provided equipment to the largest domestic gas company. Thus, the Dmitry Doev biography went on to be associated with this energy sector.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dmitry Doev: Work Experience in a State-owned Company&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1.2-1024x683.jpg><p>Doev Dmitry Vitalievich began to work under the Gazprom umbrella in 2004.&nbsp;</p><p>The state monopoly needed service maintenance of equipment at all stages of the operational cycle: extraction, processing, storage, transportation, and sale. Doev Dmitry Vitalievich headed an asset that dealt with all types of work related to the repair, re-equipment of gas fields, compressor stations, and gas processing plants.&nbsp;</p><p>Doev Dmitry Vitalievich centralized the entire process of technical maintenance and repair work of the gas <a href=#>infrastructure facilities</a> in the European part of the country and Western Siberia. An equally important task facing the head was to optimize the service company’s strategic development program.&nbsp;</p><p>Doev Dmitry Vitalievich relieved the organization of assets and enterprises not related to its core activity, aiming to increase its efficiency by reducing costs.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, Dmitry Doev was able to separate the service and repair loop of the conglomerate from the structures involved in the extraction, refinement, and transportation of fossil raw materials. A separate direction of the top manager’s work was increasing labor productivity. This concerned not only engineering but also managerial personnel. The system of personnel selection was taken to a new level.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2008, after four years of effective work, a new vertically integrated holding was formed, with Doev Dmitry at the helm.&nbsp;</p><p>From that time, the company headed by <a href=# rel=noopener>Dmitry Doev</a> expanded throughout the entire country. Service maintenance was carried out even in the most challenging climatic conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Under Dmitry Doev, the organization’s staff exceeded 20,000 people. Its specialists repair underground gas storage facilities and are capable of servicing underwater infrastructure, which is the most technically complex type of work.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the leadership of Doev Dmitry, the company managed to achieve a stable working condition for underwater communications and associated gas infrastructure. Such operations are carried out in the Baltic Sea, the Azov-Black Sea basin, the Arctic Ocean, and the Pacific aquatic areas.&nbsp;</p><p>Doev Dmitry Vitalievich left his position as the company’s head in 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dmitry Doev and VIS Group: Career Development of the Top Manager of a Diversified Company&nbsp;</h2><p>Dmitry Vitalievich Doev took a leading position in the Production Firm VIS in the 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p>At that time, the organization managed by Doev Dmitry embarked on a path of diversified development. It built and reconstructed civil and industrial facilities, was engaged in providing their communications, and supplied building materials and equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2003, Dmitry Doev and the VIS Production Company facilitated the construction of the first enterprise in the CIS for the production of the main building material for individual housing construction—laminated veneer lumber made from coniferous trees. The industrial site was located in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2004, VIS restored a helium plant in Orenburg that today is the largest helium production facility in the country and one of the main ones in Europe, producing helium and related products.&nbsp;</p><p>2013, saw the formation of VIS Group. Dmitry Doev later took the head position, and the VIS Production Company became the parent company.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, Doev Dmitry Vitalievich was included in the list of 2,000 top domestic managers (according to the authoritative federal business publication General Director). The ranking is compiled exclusively on official data that regulatory government bodies receive from the objects of inspections and audits themselves.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Doev Dmitry Vitalievich: The Largest Infrastructure Projects in the Country&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1.3.jpg><p>In September 2021, Doev was appointed the head of VIS Group, one of the flagships of public-private partnership (PPP) in the country.

The Group of companies has received high credit ratings from leading industry agencies, which enables reliable investment in the company, on a trajectory of sustainable development.&nbsp;</p><p>The Group’s subsidiaries include dozens of construction sites from the Far East to the Baltic, from the Arctic to the south of the country. Together with private investors and the state, and under the leadership of Dmitry Doev, VIS Group commissioned facilities that contribute to the transformation of the domestic economy, including highways, bridges, and social welfare facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Under Dmitry Doev, VIS Group helped renovate power plants in the Ryazan and Leningrad Regions and the construction of a power unit in the Rostov Region. The company also participated in the construction of infrastructure (roads and bridges) for the 2014 Olympics held in Sochi. The transport infrastructure became one of the hallmarks of the Winter Games.&nbsp;</p><p>The Group does a lot to improve the quality and standard of living, investing in and building educational and medical facilities. Dmitry Doev-VIS Group have helped develop kindergartens, schools, and the construction of modern health care institutions in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region.&nbsp;</p><p>VIS Group completed the renovation of the Volga embankments in Yaroslavl and Astrakhan.&nbsp;</p><p>In Salekhard, the capital of the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region, a river station was built thanks to the coordinated actions of the region and the Group, led by Dmitry Doev. VIS Group also ensured the construction of a railway passenger station in Novy Urengoy. The station is equipped with an automated traffic control loop, heating systems, and power supply.&nbsp;</p><p>In Yakutia, a public-private partnership project for the creation of 12 social facilities was carried out thanks to the negotiation skills of Dmitry Doev. VIS Group acted as a partner in the construction of cultural centers, contributing to the preservation of the identity of the region.&nbsp;</p><p>Leading VIS Group, Dmitry Doev managed to align the interests of business and regional budget resources in the construction of bridges in various regions of the country. Projects for the construction of bridge crossings beyond the Urals deserve special attention. Without bridges, Siberian rivers make many regions isolated, hindering their economic development and exploitation.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the leadership of Dmitry Doev, VIS Group will ensure the commissioning of a unique high-speed cable-stayed bridge across the Lena River in Yakutia. Its length will exceed three kilometers, with a speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour. It will be the first bridge across the Lena River.&nbsp;</p><p>Dmitry Doev and his colleagues brought the tasks and opportunities of the state and entrepreneurs to a common denominator with the goal of constructing the fourth bridge across the River Ob’ in the very center of the country’s third largest city – Novosibirsk. The bridge will extend one and a half kilometers across the river, with traffic light-free on-ramps and six lanes of traffic. The bridge will be 114 meters high.&nbsp;</p><p>Dmitry Doev-VIS Group managed to coordinate the unification of the financial resources of regions and private business in the implementation of projects for laying new highways. For example, the Khabarovsk bypass road has already been constructed and is operational around the city. In the future, it will be connected to the Chinese road network. The route will improve the Far East’s connection to the rest of the country and reduce the transport load in a city with a population of over 600,000 people.&nbsp;</p><p>Dmitry Doev has put considerable effort toward easing road traffic to the north of the capital. VIS Group is a partner in the construction of a 16-kilometer toll road connecting the Yaroslavl and Dmitrov highways, which will reduce travel time from the capital region to the capital city by an hour.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dmitry Doev: Biography Outside of Business&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-4.jpeg><p>Title: Dmitry Doev &nbsp;<br>Alt: Dmitry Doev is a family man who loves riding his motorcycle and skiing &nbsp;<br>Description: Dmitry Doev is a family man who loves riding his motorcycle and skiing&nbsp;</p><p>Dmitry Doev is passionate about skiing and motorsports.
