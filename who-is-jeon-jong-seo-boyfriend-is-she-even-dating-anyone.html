Making her debut in 2018 with Burning, her popularity increased after the 2020 movie The Call. Along with her professional life, fans were also eager to learn about her dating life.</p><p>So, when Money Heist: Korea premiered is Jeon Jong-seo had a boyfriend? Is she dating anyone? Find the answers below in this article.</p><h3><strong>Jeon Jong-seo On Money Heist</strong></h3><p>Jeon Jong-seo is playing the role of Tokyo, a North Korean immigrant worker. Tokyo made her ends meet by robbing gangsters before she joined Professor’s operation. She is tough but has stayed by the principle and adheres to Professor’s directive to avoid harming the hostages, which causes her to clash with Berlin.</p><p>In the original show, Úrsula Corberó plays the role of Tokyo.</p><p>Jong-seo shared her thoughts on the remake of the hit show.</p><p>“[The drama] does a great job portraying the near future,” she remarked. “The North Korea-South Korea situation adds an element of tension and suspense, and it also bears the meaning of unity. This two-sided situation completely fills up the background setting of the Mint”.</p><p>The actress also revealed that viewers might be surprised by her version of the Tokyo character. She commented, “I think viewers will [go into the show] imagining the free-spirited charms and vibe of Tokyo from the original version. But the Tokyo in our remake is calmer, and she’s someone who steps up and tries to resolve the situation. I tried to maintain a cleaner and more aloof tone [for our version of Tokyo]. You can look forward to seeing a new side of Jeon Jong Seo”.</p><h3><strong>Jeon Jong-seo Career</strong></h3><p>Jeon Jong-seo started her acting career when she auditioned for the part of Shin Hae-mi in the 2018 movie Burning. People were surprised when it was publicly announced that Jong-seo was starring in the Lee Chang-dong movie with no prior experience in the film industry.</p><p>As reported Korea JongAng Daily, she pushed her way through the fierce competition. She joined the cast of Lee’s mystery flick alongside famous actors like Yoo Ah-in from Veteran and Steven Yeun from AMC’s The Walking Dead.</p><p>Jong-seo was criticized for covering her face from photographers on her way to Cannes Film Festival where Burning was screened.</p><p>“I was craving an on-site film experience, but wasn’t desperate for the [‘Burning’] role,” She said of the role. “That’s because I merely considered the audition to be the first out of the myriad of auditions that I would have to go through to finally land a part”.</p><p>“I was happy about heading to Cannes, not because I was invited to the festival but because I could begin another journey with the co-stars and the director, who I really enjoyed working with,” said Jeon. “Perhaps that’s because I’m so inexperienced that I don’t know how happy I should feel about being invited to Cannes”.</p><p>“As someone who has just started a career in acting, I would like to do what I can within my range [to improve women’s rights]. So I hope to work on films that talk about women’s rights at the core,” speaking of her thriving career, she added. “I hope people pay more attention to trying to create a better environment [for women]”.</p><p>“I want to become a happy person. Being an actor is a job I have, and I am a human being before being an actor. I hope that the profession doesn’t change who I am as a person”.</p><p>According to her IMDB, other notable works are The Call, Mona Lisa & the Blood Moon, and Nothing Serious.</p><p>She has also made an appearance on Knowing Bros.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Jeon Jong-seo Boyfriend?
