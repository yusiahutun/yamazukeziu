Some of our very early businesses that got the whole community started, and about the various cultures,” said Linda Anderson, research assistant and spokesperson for QC PastPort. “The various immigrants who came here, and what they brought to our community.”</p><p>The PastPort sites will stretch across Moline, Davenport and Bettendorf, encouraging Channel Cat Passengers to bridge the gap between each city as they learn and explore the diverse history of each community that helps to make up the Quad Cities.</p><p>“This will kind of bring a lot of that history to one place, and I think it’ll help all of the Quad Cities,” said Anderson. “I think it’s a good way to have people go from place to place when they come to visit.”</p><p>Rock Island resident Natalie Linville-Mass says the Channel Cat is something the whole family can enjoy.</p><p>“It’s exciting because you’re on a boat, and that’s something that not everybody gets to do, and it’s not that expensive to do,” said Linville-Mass. “It’s something that I brought my kids on from a very early age.”</p><p>Linville-Mass emphasizes the importance of experiencing local landmarks firsthand.</p><p>“The Mississippi is historic … it’s huge … and we need to be able to celebrate that. It’s a main attraction whenever any of my friends or relatives come here,” said Linville-Mass. “You’re at the place where it happened, and I think that’s really important. It’s really important that you can be there and experience what’s going on, and then to be able to hear from somebody that had something to do with that place is really a big deal.”</p><p>This year’s Channel Cat schedule is <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></strong>.</p><p>Follow the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Channel Cat Water Taxi on Facebook</a></strong> for updates.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJqhmZ6jsq15wpqrZq%2BRqbKzedOar6Jlopq8sbHNrGSwoaSdeq%2Bx1madnpmkqr%2Bmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
