Your heart is opening every step of the way, which is harder (and more beautiful) than it sounds.</p><p>The week begins with the <a href=#>sun </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">entering</a><a href=#> Pisces</a> on February 18, bringing you to the end of your journey through the cosmos. Pisces is the last sign in the zodiac wheel, which means you’re approaching endings and forgiving moments that set you free from the past. And as Chiron—the wounded healer—immediately joins forces with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the North Node in Aries</a> on February 19, you’re learning how to set aside your ego for the sake of even higher growth. Let go of codependency and toxic relationships, especially if it’s inhibiting your freedom and self-expression.</p><p>A moment of passion and romance erupts as <a href=#>Venus</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">—</a><a href=#>planet of love</a>—forms a conjunction with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mars—planet of intensity and power</a>—on February 22. This could raise the sexual tension to an almost irresistible degree, breaking down people’s barriers and driving them toward connection. Because this conjunction takes place in Aquarius, it could also lead to growth in platonic relationships and community-oriented endeavors.</p><p>This is all leading up to the highlight of the week—<a href=#>a full moon </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on</a><a href=#> February 24</a>. This full moon takes place in practical and rational Virgo, providing clarity to the emotional and esoteric nature of Pisces. Get ready to take intentional and actionable steps toward solving your problems. You might even have fun doing it, as Venus will immediately square off with optimistic and larger-than-life Jupiter, driving you to embrace your desires and sense of indulgence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=7.6910569105691><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_aries.png><p>This week, a relationship gets interesting.</p><p>The week begins on Sunday, February 18, with the sun entering the sign of Pisces.
