"It's political correctness gone mad."</p><p>Professional Darts Corporation boss Barry Hearn was also interviewed for the programme where he admitted the same, but said: "That's the world we live in now".</p><p>But for Daniella and Charlotte, it meant they lost a lot of money as working as walk-on girls brought in about 60% of their earnings.</p><p>Daniella says: "We have lost income. We are self-employed and the work comes as and when.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19262686.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Daniella-Allfree-and-Charlotte-Wood-727274><p>"It's not the steady wage we had working with the PDC."</p><p>The pair also noticed how the players missed them at the recent World Matchplay tournament in Blackpool one of the biggest on the darts circuit.</p><p>Daniella says: "Watching it on TV, it didn't look like the same show.</p><p>"Even the darts players said they felt lonely with-without the walk-on girls. A couple of players actually tripped up as they walked on because we weren't there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19293928.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Daniella-Allfree-and-Charlotte-Wood-1440185><p>"A lot of them are very nervous before a big match like that, so it was nice for them to have someone beside them to walk to the stage.</p><p>"Surely it must feel different for them after all these years of having someone with them for their entrance?</p><p>"Some players are really quite shy so I think it did help them."</p><p>Daniella and Charlotte are still popular at exhibition matches, where they have been overwhelmed by support from fans and players.</p><p>"Just speaking to the players on the circuit at exhibitions, they're saying how much they miss us," adds Daniella.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19262688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Daniella-and-Charlotte-s-calendar-is-available-to-pre-order-now-1440193><p>"We've had a lot of response from players and we still get support from fans on social media - women as well as men."</p><p>This prompted the pair to make their third calendar, which is out for pre-order now and which, sadly for fans, will be their last.</p><p>"We didn't think there would be a demand for it," says Daniella.</p><p>"But we put out a post on Instagram and got thousands of responses asking us to do it.</p><p>"One of the darts players, Vincent van der Voort, has bought a massive batch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19272784.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Daniella-Allfree-1440189><p>"He bought some last year and they sold really well so this year he told us he wanted loads for his shop in Holland."</p><p>Initially the pair were upset but were amazed at the support they had when they were dropped.</p><p>But eight months on, they still haven't had a proper explanation, and feel resentment at the decision. They had been a fixture of the darts circuit - Daniella for six years and Charlotte for three and a half - and had even been assured their jobs were safe.</p><p>"There's still not been a formal explanation or statement," says Daniella.</p><p>“We've felt more bitter about it as time has gone on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19262689.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Daniella-1440194><p>"We were treated harshly - dropped from a job we put a lot of time into, without explanation.</p><p>"We were told we were doing a good job and would be with them for a long time but then we were dropped."</p><p>It's been made even worse for Daniella and Charlotte as walk-on girls still work at PDC tournaments on the Continent.</p><p>On the website, there's even a guide to the walk-on girls, with a section on how you can become one.</p><p>"It's still the PDC, it's still the same company and it's still being broadcast on ITV, on UK television," says Daniella. "Fans can still see the girls do walk-ons in European events.</p><p>"It is baffling to think why would they still have them in those countries but not in the UK?</p><p>"And there are ring girls at boxing matches and the dancers at the darts - who wear a lot less than we did.</p><p>"So I don't know why we were dropped and they stayed."</p><p>The models have also been selling off the dresses they wore as walk-on girls, which have been snapped up by fans.</p><p>"There's a big demand for them," explains Daniella.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article19276590.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Daniella-1440197.jpg><p>"The last one I sold had 50 bids and the winner wanted it signed and with a note of authenticity.
