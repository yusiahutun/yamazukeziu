Vanity sizing has also played a part here, with garments being labelled with smaller numbers to make women with growing waists feel smaller and thinner.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Clothing manufacturers do it intentionally because it helps them sell clothes,' Max went on. 'There has been a lot of research on vanity sizing, and when people fit into a smaller size, it raises their self esteem and makes them more likely to buy.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'In that regard, clothing cuts probably would have gotten bigger to some degree even if people had not. But I think most of the change in sizing is a result of clothing manufacturers trying to keep up with a growing customer base.'</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn%2BQcm9sb2RkkKmt0a1kq52mmq6tv4yco6ismJ67qHnSorGeq12YtaK6xp6bZqiRqMFugo9msJ6Zoqh6tLTOsKpmq5mvsm59kWaEmqqZocaveayopaunlWJ9cXmXZquonJGue6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
