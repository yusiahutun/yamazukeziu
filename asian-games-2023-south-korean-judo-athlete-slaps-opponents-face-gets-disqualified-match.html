The Kazakhstani turned away at first and then fell to the ground clutching her face and beating the ground in pain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/24/1c13cbef-d6a1-4903-b8c6-fb63cb24c200_bf0b3dc9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A concerned Lee went straight over to her and put a hand on her back but the damage had already been done and the referee asked her to step away.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The coaches and crowd were left watching in confusion as Abuzhakynova rolled around on the mat in seeming agony before she stood up, revealing a scratch under her left eye. After a while, Abuzhakynova returned to the matt and assumed position, only for Lee to be shown a red card.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee barely reacted but her coach stood up with raised arms questioning the decision. Abuzhakynova walked over to Lee and they shook hands before the Kazakhstani made a rushed exit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/24/8492bfee-3106-43fa-b0be-c2baff7d251b_4a3d3196.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After her disqualification, Lee no longer had a shot at winning a bronze medal in the play-off, with the other losing semi-finalist – Uzbekistan’s Kurbonova Khalimajon – winning by default.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Abuzhakynova went on to lose in the final as Natsumi Tsunoda secured Japan’s first gold medal at this year’s Asian Games on Sunday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese netizens were torn over whether Lee’s slap was intentional or an accident, giving the incident a lot of attention, as the topic soared to the top of social media platform Weibo’s trending list with over 2 million views.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/24/a9997c2a-6998-4ff4-8f3a-94685d8bb177_59125db5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As a professional athlete there is no way she would do this on purpose, I think it was just a slip. Her opponent’s reaction is also way over the top,” a Weibo user wrote.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another user said: “It does not matter what her reason was [for the slap], the right decision was made”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was not the first time Abuzhakynova had left a match hurt after facing Lee.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In February, they battled it out for bronze at the Paris Grand Prix, a match won by Abuzhakynova, but the Kazakhstani left with a bandage around her head.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mnKCZo65wrdGtoJyklWSAc3%2BUb2pwZ5GotqK6jKCYpp2jYn9xfpJmqqitpJ16rLvRnpinZZqqsbB5wK2fpZ2kmnq0uMCpqmanoKW8r7HNrapmnpGYsm6zxK2qZpyZqL62rcuinaKdlGK6osDCoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
