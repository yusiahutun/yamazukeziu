Jelly and Gilbert performed "Son of the Dirty South," a mish-mash of hard rock, hard-edged country and rap that the two artists released in 2022.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, Jelly Roll has made headway as a balladeer, especially with his breakout country radio hit, "Son of a Sinner." But on Tuesday night, he reminded the crowd that hip-hop is a major component of his musical foundation, rapping a verse over screeching guitars, volcanic bursts of pyrotechnics and the occasional emphatic lyrical interjection from Gilbert.</p><p>Playing Bridgestone Arena is always a triumphant moment for Jelly Roll, a Music City native who frequently waxes emotional about his long, pothole-pocked road to success. He's now played the venue several times, even selling it out under his own name as a headliner. After his landmark first sell-out at the venue in late 2022, he directed all proceeds toward local youth outreach, earmarking funds to build a recording studio at the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center where he himself once served time as a teen.</p><p>If Jelly Roll played early in the night on Tuesday in Nashville, it's not because he's not headliner caliber. He had to play Bridgestone early in order to jet out to Huntsville, Ala., where he performed a headlining slot on his current <a href=#>Backroad Baptism Tour.</a></p><h2 class=photogallery-title>11 Songs that Foreshadowed Jelly Roll's Country Music Career</h2><p>Jelly Roll has taken the country music world by storm over the past year, and he will release his first full-length country album, Whitsitt Chapel, on June 2. Before he jumps right into the deepend of the genre, let's take a walk down memory lane. There are 11 songs that seemed to foreshadow his country music career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo52cocZuvs6lo2aaopa7tbjEsmSgoZyXsrPAjKegnKOVoa%2Bir8pmq6itomLAtbvPZqWaq5irtq24xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
