That can come with personal challenges like losing or gaining weight. Zoe Kravitz joins a long list of <a href=#>Hollywood</a> icons who have openly discussed the struggles of going through such a drastic journey and how it can affect their mental health in the course of the transformation.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1702686921-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zoe-kravitz-recalls-her-worst-days-battling-eating-disorder>Zoe Kravitz recalls her ‘worst days’ battling eating disorder</h2><p>The Batman star Zoe Kravitz once had to go down to &nbsp;90 lbs to portray an anorexic girl in the film&nbsp;The Road Within. But the drastic weight loss scared her parents as the 35-year-old <a href=#>celebrity</a> battled an eating disorder for years when she was in high school. Recalling her ‘worst days,’ Zoe <a href=# rel=nofollow>shared</a>: “It was really, really bad in high school. When I was 16, 17, 18, it was at its worst and it trickled into my early 20s.”</p><p>The actress was candid about the struggle as she revealed, “You convince yourself it’s okay but you know you have a problem. Like trying not to eat and throwing up and then binging and purging, you know you have a problem.”</p><p>The <a href=#>movie</a> star’s struggle didn’t go unnoticed by her actress mother Lisa Bonet and her father&nbsp;Lenny Kravitz. Zoe shared that even her parents’ glam lives and beautiful appearances contributed to her feelings. “My mother&nbsp;was so beautiful and so tiny, I always felt clunky around her, and then my dad was always surrounded by supermodels. I was short, and you feel uncomfortable in your skin anyway at that age.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1197767028-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-was-scary>“It was scary”</h2><p>Years after dealing with the eating disorder, Zoe Kravitz’s parents were concerned when she went through a drastic weight loss for The Road Within. The actress <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Vogue: “My parents got really scared for me to go back down that road. It was f**ked up, man. You could see my rib cage. I was just trying to lose more weight for the film but I couldn’t see: You’re there. Stop. It was scary.”</p><p>But after going through a terrifying time, the Big Little Lies star finally put it to an end by coming to a resolution.</p><p>“I just felt it was different. I don’t know if a f**king spirit came over me and said: ”You have to stop. I feel like something has left my body, like some part of me is gone now, something that was making me so insecure. And it feels amazing.”</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know needs support, there are many eating disorder helplines in the UK here to help.
