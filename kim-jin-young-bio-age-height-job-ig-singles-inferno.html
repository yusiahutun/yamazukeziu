His appearance has attracted people in and outside of the show in season 2. That means fan wants to connect with him on whatever platform possible. Furthermore, they want to learn more about him.</p><p>This bio is about his age, job, height, and more.</p><h3><strong>Kim Jin-Young On Netflix’s Single’s Inferno</strong></h3><p>Drama in Single’s Inferno is far from over as a new contestant has joined in shaking up some connections on the show. Kim Jin-Young joined the cast of Netflix’s popular show in episodes 3 and 4. “I work out about five times a week doing weight training, and I also run,” Jin-young explained. “I regularly do high-intensity activities, so I’m confident that I won’t fall behind others when it comes to athletic performance.”</p><p>“I’m shy at first, but once we get to know each other, I think I’m someone you can have fun with,” he explained in his introduction. “When I see a woman, it takes me only three seconds to feel sparks. So I hope that when I join Single’s Inferno, there will be a woman who I feel sparks for within three seconds.”</p><p>Immediately after Kim arrived in episode 3, he is able to secure a date with two women of his choosing and to his shocking surprise, he picked <a href=#>Seul-ki</a> and <a href=#>Seo-eun</a>.</p><p>These two hot contestants had the interest of all the men on the show which shocked Kim Jin-Young’s fellow male contestants. The women meet up again in their tent in Single’s Inferno Season 2 Episode 4, and Seul-ki is immediately charmed by Jin-young. He is dating Seul-ki and Seo-eun, and it is obvious that his cool manner has caught their attention.</p><p>His attitude has won over the hosts as well. Later, Se-jeong and Nadine also express interest in knowing him. When Se-jeong is able to speak with him one-on-one, she too falls in love.</p><p>So-e was the sole woman who, in contrast to the other ladies, had never affected her emotions. She speaks with Yoong-jae and demonstrates promise. But in Season 2 of Single’s Inferno, everything changes when the women decide who they want to travel to Paradise with. Jin-young admits he connected with Seul-ki as he prepares to make his choice. She ultimately chose Jin-young as well, making this her second visit to Paradise.</p><p>Sadly, Jong-woo’s heart&nbsp;was once more destroyed when Seul-ki chose someone else. The good news is that Han-bin chose Seo-eun, and she chose him as well. Unexpectedly, Dong-wook cried out for Nadine. She joyfully emerges from the tent. More shocking, though, is when Yoong-jae also picked Nadine. It stuns the hosts when they realize he likely picked her to avoid So-e, knowing she chose him.</p><p>But the following episode of&nbsp;Single’s Inferno&nbsp;Season 2 teases sparks flying between Jin-young and Seul-ki.</p><h3><strong>Kim Jin-Young Job</strong></h3><p>Kin Jin-Young is known as Dex, a popular YouTuber, and Streamer.

One of their similarities was their long hair and sleeve tattoos. Along with Jin-Young’s personality, his intricate tattoos have also drawn the attention of fans. He also touched on what his tattoo represented.</p><p>Kim Jin-Young said: “This holds the meaning of warrior, that kind of tattoo.” He added that he was a soldier once and doesn’t believe in religion.</p><p>The reality star then added said: “I had the UDT tattooed on myself, they’re bullets, and the shapes are bullets.
