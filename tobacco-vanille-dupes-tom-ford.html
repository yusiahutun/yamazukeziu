I first got a whiff of the beautifully balanced sweet-smokey unisex <a href=# id=auto-tag_perfume data-tag=perfume>perfume</a> in high school while getting my hair done, and I couldn’t help but ask what my colorist was wearing that smelled like literal heaven on earth. After she ~kindly~ revealed her secret (I know some people are private about divulging their <a href=# rel=noopener>signature scent)</a> I immediately went home on a mission to find out where I could find a bottle of my own, and nervously, figure out how much it would cost me. Tragically enough, I quickly learned it was nearly $250 a pop for the medium-sized bottle—a rather lofty price tag that my seventeen-year self, who was definitely not in the position to be able to afford—regardless of how enamored I was by the multifaceted <a href=# id=auto-tag_fragrance-2 data-tag=fragrance-2>fragrance</a>.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Alas, I filled the void and satisfied my cravings for Tobacco Vanille by making sure to stop in Neiman Marcus during each trip to the mall so I could douse myself in Tobacco Vanille sample bottles (I had no shame, clearly) for free. Each time I wore it, I got plenty of compliments and inquiries about what I was wearing, but more importantly, it helped me discover that fragrance (whether it be by way of <a href=# rel=noopener>smelling perfume</a> or a batch of cookies) had a therapeutic effect on me, so eventually, I reasoned that the mood-lifting properties the Tobacco Vanille exuded justified the investment. I started with buying samples of the perfume on eBay, and since the Eau de Parfum is so concentrated and therefore, a little goes a long way, I was able my minis last quite a while if I reserved using them for special occasions or the days when I was in dire need of an olfactory pick-me-up.</p><p>In my late twenties, I finally indulged my decade-long dream of owning a full-size bottle all to myself and took the plunge. Did I regret the splurge? Not at all, but I can’t say that the noteworthy dent in my bank account after I ordered it didn’t leave me wondering if there were any <a href=# rel=noopener>affordable dupes</a> to the luxury fragrance of my dreams. After ample research, I can confirm that, while nothing is an exact clone of the proprietary fragrance, there are some cheaper perfume and colognes that come pretty close to capturing its scent but cost a fraction of the price.</p><p class=p1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
