These seem like easy qualifications, but you’d be surprised by how many formulas instead leave skin feeling dull and somehow drier.

In terms of acids, you’ll find salicylic, hyaluronic and glycolic front and center. They’re the Holy Trinity, if you will. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Salicylic acid</a> (a beta-hydroxy acid (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>BHA</a>)) is known for its ability to clear pores, get rid of blackheads and calm redness and inflammation. Similarly, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>glycolic acid</a> (an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>AHA</a> (alpha-hydroxy acid)) exfoliates the skin by sloughing off dead skin cells and replacing them with new, brighter ones. While this might sound like a lot of decongesting and exfoliating, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>hyaluronic acid</a> swoops in to provide ample hydration. This all-star humectant is known to lock in moisture and can hold 1,000 times its weight in water. Acids aside, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>aloe</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>vitamin B5</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>shea butter</a> also make this face cream a must-try. I’m beginning to think calling this ingredient list “stacked” is an understatement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/seoulceuticals-ultra-glow-turmeric-face-cream-amazon.png><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$18</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$19</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>5% Off</span></p><p>Together, these elements bring you hydrated, glowy, even, radiant skin.
