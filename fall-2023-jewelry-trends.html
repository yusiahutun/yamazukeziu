She believed necklaces were over after seeing a handful of celebrities styled without them on the red carpet. The idea was given a name, “necklace theory,” and the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiktok.com/tag/necklacetheory data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="corresponding hashtag" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">corresponding hashtag</a> has over 680,000 views.</p><p>Then came the fall 2023 runways, and necklace theory was over just as quickly as it began. Models at Schiaparelli and Ferragamo weren’t just wearing necklaces—they were wearing extremely large necklaces that looked like more like precious objects cast in silver or gold and worn around the neck. Large necklaces weren’t the only jewelry trend of note, either. At Coperni, there were brooches, like a cheeky, chunky silver one in the shape of a hand pinching at a model’s left breast and ruching the knit sweater she wore in the process. At Simone Rocha, models wore dainty red ribbons under their eyes to match those tied to their dangling crystal earrings. Bottega Veneta’s large drop earrings, which look like a pair of bubbly cartoon raindrops dipped in gold, incited an online hysteria that caused them to sell out across the globe while inspiring thousands of lackluster dupes.</p><p>And so the only jewelry theory I’m currently invested in is this one: Jewelry for fall isn’t just happening—it’s also big and exaggerated and funny and, at times, hyperfeminine. Designers do appear to be focusing on timeless wardrobe essentials as of late, but they’re also making some eccentric baubles to go with them, to add pizzazz.</p><p>Read on for the six biggest jewelry trends of fall 2023.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Fall 2023 Jewelry Trends: Proudly Your Grandma’s Brooches</h2><img alt="model on the runway at coperni fall 2023 ready to wear fashion show on march 3, 2023 at palais de chaillot in paris, france photo by aitor rosas sunewwd via getty images" title="Coperni - Fall 2023 RTW - Runway - PFW" width=4000 height=6000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1247713706-64e3bb0e416e8.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Coperni</span></p><img alt="paris, france july 03 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the schiaparelli haute couture fallwinter 20232024 show as part of paris fashion week on july 03, 2023 in paris, france photo by peter whitegetty images" title="Schiaparelli : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2023/2024" width=2506 height=3759 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1511953677-64e3bb28099ca.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Schiaparelli</span></p><img alt="london, england october 12 a model walks the runway during the alexander mcqueen ready to wear springsummer 2022 fashion show as part of the london fashion week on october 12, 2021 in london, united kingdom photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Alexander McQueen - Runway - LFW September 2021" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1347647639-64e3bb3dd5e79.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Alexander McQueen</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Queen Elizabeth II is the poster girl for brooches. When you Google brooches, most of the images are of her, smiling from ear to ear with a sparkling collection of pearls, diamonds, and gems gathered at her lapels. She was known to have an extensive collection of over 98, and certainly did not help change the reputation for the accessory, which is often associated with grandmas and geriatrics and the kind of quirky maximalists who would raise more than 30 corgis.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But the fall 2023 runways proved that brooches deserve as much attention as any other piece of jewelry, and not by trying to change how they’re perceived, but by presenting them as they are. At Schiaparelli, a model wore a brooch that appeared like an enormous silver leaf peeking out from under her enormous coat. At Alexander McQueen, there were blazers covered entirely in silver embellishments, a look that could easily be achieved by wearing multiple brooches at once. At Coperni, things got cheeky with the aforementioned hand brooch that gave the illusion of pinching the model’s nipple. They all looked like something you could imagine on Her Majesty or a stylish grandma from the Upper East Side—and that felt like the point. Brooches make you look like you’re wise beyond your years and have the accessories to prove it.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Fall 2023 Jewelry Trends: Anti–Necklace Theory Necklaces</h2><img alt="paris, france july 03 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the schiaparelli haute couture fallwinter 20232024 show as part of paris fashion week on july 03, 2023 in paris, france photo by peter whitegetty images" title="Schiaparelli : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2023/2024" width=3151 height=4726 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1511956448-1-64e3be003d591.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Schiaparelli</span></p><img alt="milan, italy february 25 a model walks the runway during the salvatore ferragamo ready to wear fallwinter 2023 2024 fashion show as part of the milan fashion week on february 25, 2023 in milan, italy photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Salvatore Ferragamo - Runway - Milan Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2023-2024" width=2843 height=4265 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1469675086-64e3be2736505.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ferragamo</span></p><img alt=courrèges title=courrèges width=1052 height=1582 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-08-21-at-3-40-53-pm-64e3be371f3e1.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courrèges</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In theory, necklace theory makes sense. The kind of necklaces that have populated our social media feeds for the past couple of years have been dainty and light; they have been easy to miss, gracing collarbones like a rogue pen mark in the margins of a notepad.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But they seem to mostly have disappeared as soon as the the term personal style picked up speed on our algorithms. Long gone are the day of minimalist chains—if you see someone wearing some, they are likely just branches for clunky charms to hang off of. The fall runways took this chunky look one step further, with models at Courrèges and Ferragamo wearing necklaces so large, they looked more like chic medals or chokers.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Fall 2023 Jewelry Trends: Girlhood Medallions</h2><img alt="london, england february 18 a model walks the runway during the simone rocha ready to wear fallwinter 2023 2024 fashion show as part of the london fashion week on february 18, 2023 in london, united kingdom photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Simone Rocha - Runway - Fall/Winter 2023-2024" width=2833 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1467441057-64e3c49bae83b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">SIMONE ROCHA</span></p><img alt="sandy liang runway" title="sandy liang runway" width=1164 height=1760 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-08-21-at-3-48-24-pm-64e3c54abe867.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sandy Liang</span></p><img alt="model on the runway at paco rabanne fall 2023 ready to wear fashion show on march 1, 2023 at the palais de tokyo in paris, france photo by giovanni giannoniwwd via getty images" title="Paco Rabanne - RTW Fall 2023 - Runway - PFW" width=4128 height=6192 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1247680918-64e3c5a810634.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Paco Rabanne</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Plenty of people have declared this the Summer of Girlhood.

If you don’t want to do it by dressing in romantic puff-sleeve tops or floral shift dresses, you can always just wear a pair of Simone Rocha earrings with ribbons tied tightly around their iridescent beads or a Sandy Liang floral corsage choker over the neck of an oversize sweater. While you’re at it, use eyelash glue to stick a couple of matching bows under your eyes or in your hair, as models at both Simone Rocha and Sandy Liang did.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Fall 2023 Jewelry Trends: Weight of the World Earrings</h2><img alt="alexander mcqueen" title="alexander mcqueen" width=1090 height=1650 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2023-08-21-at-5-45-38-pm-64e3db195ef1c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Alexander McQueen</span></p><img alt="emily ratajkowski on the runway at versace rtw fall 2023 on march 9, 2023 in los angeles, california photo by manny llanurawwd via getty images" title="Versace RTW Fall 2023 - Runway" width=3600 height=5400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1247995791-64e3da72ac68f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Versace</span></p><img alt="milan, italy february 25 a model walks the runway during the bottega veneta ready to wear fallwinter 2023 2024 fashion show as part of the milan fashion week on february 25, 2023 in milan, italy photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Bottega Veneta - Runway - Milan Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2023-2024" width=2837 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1469748018-64e3da852973e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bottega Veneta</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><br>There are few delights quite like the sensation of a large earrings moving in unison with your facial expressions.

In 2023, though, they can sometimes run the risk of looking too much like part of a gladiator costume.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And yet the runway models of Saint Laurent gladly prove that assumption incorrect. For the past couple of seasons, they’ve been effortlessly demonstrating how thick bands worn around the wrist look every bit as regal as anything else. A singular cuff also packs a punch, and eliminates the need to save up for an entire heap of bracelets that will somehow manage to get tangled before bed. No worries, thick cuffs still feel like an arm party—just a bit more edited and sleek than a stack.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
