The Duchess of Cambridge looked spectacular as she attended the <a href=#>annual church service at Westminster Abbey for Commonwealth Day</a>, which honors the family of 53 nations that have <strong>Queen Elizabeth</strong> as their head of state.</p><p>As she stepped out for the special engagement on Monday, March 11, the 37-year-old donned a familiar-looking red coat dress. Eagle-eyed admirers soon realized that Kate was doing a royal rewear! The brunette beauty first wore the stunning 18-button red Catherine Walker ensemble in April 2014 during a tour in New Zealand with <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Prince George</strong></a>, who was around 9 months old at the time. <strong>Take a look at the one coat dress worn on two different occasions below!</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/kate-middleton-red-coat-prince-george-rewear.jpg><p>The duchess switched things up accessory-wise this time around, pairing her fiery look with a matching red fascinator rather than the pillbox hat she wore while previously carrying George, now 5, off the tarmac. By wearing the design, Kate gave a sweet nod to her late mother-in-law, <a href=#><strong>Princess Diana</strong></a>, who was known to favor Catherine Walker’s creations. Kate has even worn several outfits from the designer in recent years.</p><p>Other royal family members joined the mom-of-three and hubby William, 36, at the high-profile outing. <strong><a href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a></strong> was, of course, in attendance as was <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a>, <strong><a href=#>Prince Harry</a>,</strong> <a href=#><strong>Prince Charles</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall</strong></a>. As their husbands shook hands, Kate and Meg, also 37, greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/royal-family-commonwealth-day.jpg><p>This year’s service — marking the 70th anniversary of the modern Commonwealth — included a performance by Grammy-winning group Clean Bandit and <strong>Alfie Boe</strong>, the U.K.’s biggest-selling tenor. <strong>Lewis Pugh</strong>, an endurance swimmer, ocean advocate and the UN Patron of the Oceans also gave a speech.</p><p>Young people were the topic for much of the church service, which makes sense considering 60 percent of the Commonwealth’s population is under the age of 30. In fact, the high percentage of millennials recently led to Harry, 34, being named Youth Ambassador for the organization by his grandmother last year. Because of that, Harry and Meghan have since made Commonwealth a central part of their public life. Good for them!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46kmK2dXaK2pbDLnquopl2nsqV5wqiYrWWUp7K0v4yrprKZnGK%2FpsPEmqlmm5%2BiurC61p6YpayYYrGixY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
