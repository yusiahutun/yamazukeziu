So what’s the difference."</p><p>Director and writer Gene Stupnitsky agrees, noting that there was a 15-year age difference between Lawrence and her older co-star <a href=#><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></a> in "Silver Linings Playbook," and no one batted an eye. "It goes the other way, too," he noted.</p><p>Of course, the bigger complaint about the film is the whole point of it, with some taking issue with the very idea of parents hiring someone to "date" their kid, with even the trailer making it very clear what they mean by date when Lawrence's character asks that very question.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:779cdcfd-958d-4b07-a7eb-d8160096adb0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2cf0beb4-0c7d-498f-82e1-2d422c902fe2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5d/5by4/2023/06/22/5d19b8b18d294bafa8022dfdda464af2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jennifer Lawrence Breaks Down in Tears Eating Spicy Wings on Hot Ones</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Date him hard," says <a href=#><strong>Matthew Broderick's</strong></a> father character, as wife <a href=#><strong>Laura Benanti</strong></a> looks on. "I'll date his brains out," Lawrence agrees.</p><p>The idea that this is overstepping any and all parental boundaries, and a little bit creepy, is so much the point of the satire. But that hasn't stopped the outrage.</p><p>"I feel like it is a very satirical look at what can happen if you do not give your children a longer leash to figure things out for themselves," she told THR. "Otherwise, you’re going to end up curating their life forever."</p><p>"I guess what happens is when a kid goes off to school, it’s so frightening that they’ll be happy and they’ll make friends and they’ll take care of themselves that some parents go to any length to make that transition work. And it’s a hard time. I’ve been through it," Broderick agreed. "But you really have to let them make it on their own. But these parents decide to mess with nature."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4f83879a-4da3-4411-9abc-fbefdf29c3c9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2cf0beb4-0c7d-498f-82e1-2d422c902fe2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8c/5by4/2023/03/09/8ca72b6c73884c969ec4d744d4adf2ad_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Sony Pictures</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jennifer Lawrence Seduces 19-Year-Old In Red Band Trailer for No Hard Feelings</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Producer Naomi Odenkirk, who found the Craigslist ad that inspired the film's premise, said, "It’s parents overstepping their bounds, for sure."</p><p>Fellow producer Marc Provissiero added, "It's not that far removed from actual parenting choices. You want to do everything you can for your kid. Where’s the line."</p><p>Stupnitsky challenges all those people icked out by the premise to actually step outside of their outrage and consider seeing the movie. "If you feel that way when you come out of the movie, I would be surprised," he told THR.</p><p>"We took great pains to be careful about the ick factor because it could go that way," he continued. "We took a humanist approach and I think that’s all you can ask for."</p><p>The moral of this story is to let your kids find their own way -- and maybe don't judge a film by its trailer (even though that's kind of the point). Comedy is hard.</p><a id=gallery-link-9204fcfc-c0f7-4110-ad4b-968695c5d348 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9204fcfc-c0f7-4110-ad4b-968695c5d348 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:2cf0beb4-0c7d-498f-82e1-2d422c902fe2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bb/4by3/2023/06/19/bbf7de673ab843b6a251cbf83a757b15_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29ma21fo7xutMCrm2aelZq5qrrGrGScmaOpeqS%2BxJqrqKqjYr2ivsSnq6xlmJ6%2FqrrGZqGepp6es6a%2BjKWYsKqVo7CmecOinZ%2Bdopq7pLGMm5ico5yWwKl7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
