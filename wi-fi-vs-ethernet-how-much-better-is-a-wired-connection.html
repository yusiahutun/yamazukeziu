You should use a wired connection whenever it is practical if performance is a priority, although newer Wi-Fi standards like Wi-Fi 6 have narrowed the performance gap significantly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wi-Fi is extremely convenient for small, portable devices, but when performance is required, you cannot beat an Ethernet connection. Ethernet connections are several times faster than most Wi-Fi networks, and typically have a fraction of the latency.</p><h2 id=is-ethernet-faster-than-wi-fi>Is Ethernet Faster Than Wi-Fi?</h2><p>Yes, Ethernet is faster than <a href=#>Wi-Fi</a>. The best Ethernet cables you'll commonly find are <a href=#>Cat6A cables</a> --- they're rated for transfer speeds of 10 <a href=#>gigabits per second (Gbps or Gb/s)</a>, and they'll deliver that very consistently. <a href=#>Wi-Fi 6E</a>, which is currently the fastest Wi-Fi officially available, can only reach speeds of a few gigabits per second. Ethernet connections are also less prone to interference and have lower latency than even the best Wi-Fi networks. If reliability and speed are the priority, <a href=#>Ethernet cables</a> cannot be beat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-faster-is-ethernet>How Much Faster Is Ethernet?</h2><p>Ethernet is just plain faster than Wi-Fi --- there's no getting around that fact. But the real-world differences are smaller than you might think. <a href=#>Wi-Fi has gotten significantly&nbsp;faster over the last few years</a>, thanks to new standards like Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), which offers a maximum speed of about 9.6 gigabits per second. Even though this is a maximum speed for all your wireless devices to share (and you likely won't get those speeds in the real world), Wi-Fi has become good enough to handle most of our daily tasks.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Upgrade Your Wireless Router to Get Faster Speeds and More Reliable Wi-Fi</a></span></p><p>On the other hand, a wired Ethernet connection can theoretically offer up to 10 Gbps, if you have a Cat6A cable. The exact maximum speed of your Ethernet cable depends on the type of Ethernet cable you're using. However, even the Cat5e&nbsp;cable in common use supports up to 1 Gbps. And, unlike with Wi-Fi, that speed is consistent.</p><p>Here is a small chart showing the best speeds you can get through <a href=#>different Ethernet cables</a> and modern Wi-Fi networks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unless otherwise noted, the maximum speed of the Ethernet cable is the speed at the end of a 100-meter cable.&nbsp;</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 style=border-collapse:collapse;width:43.8105%;height:193px align summary><tbody><tr style=height:20px><td style=width:22.1429%;height:20px><p>Connection Type</p></td><td style=width:21.6662%;height:20px><p>Maximum Speed</p></td></tr><tr style=height:20px><td style=width:22.1429%;height:20px><p>Cat5</p></td><td style=width:21.6662%;height:20px><p>100 Mbps</p></td></tr><tr style=height:20px><td style=width:22.1429%;height:20px><p>Cat5e</p></td><td style=width:21.6662%;height:20px><p>1 Gbps</p></td></tr><tr style=height:20px><td style=width:22.1429%;height:20px><p>Cat6</p></td><td style=width:21.6662%;height:20px><p>1 Gbps</p></td></tr><tr style=height:20px><td style=width:22.1429%;height:20px><p>Cat6a</p></td><td style=width:21.6662%;height:20px><p>10 Gbps</p></td></tr><tr><td style=width:22.1429%><p>Wi-Fi 5</p></td><td style=width:21.6662%><p>3.5 Gbps</p></td></tr><tr><td style=width:22.1429%><p>Wi-Fi 6</p></td><td style=width:21.6662%><p>9.6 Gbps</p></td></tr><tr><td style=width:22.1429%><p>Wi-Fi 6E</p></td><td style=width:21.6662%><p>9.6 Gbps</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is important to understand that the maximum speed listed for Wi-Fi networks is the maximum bandwidth for all devices on the network, not an individual connection.

It's just that simple.</p><p>Wi-Fi is subject to a lot more interference than a wired connection. The layout of your home, objects blocking the signal, interference from electrical devices or <a href=#>your neighbors' Wi-Fi networks</a>---all these things contribute to Wi-Fi being generally less reliable.</p><p>This interference can cause a number of problems:</p><ul><li><strong>Dropped signals:</strong> Occasionally, Wi-Fi will lose the signal and have to reacquire it. This may not be a big deal for daily browsing or even streaming video (which gets buffered on the local device), because the re-acquisition happens quickly. But if you play online games, it can get pretty irritating.</li><li><strong>Higher latency:</strong> Increased interference can mean higher latency, which can be a problem for all the reasons we outlined in the previous section.</li><li><strong>Lowered speeds:</strong> More interference also means lower signal quality, which results in lower connection speeds.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How To Get a Better Wireless Signal and Reduce Wireless Network Interference</a></span></p><p>It's tough to quantify interference because it tends to ebb and flow --- especially if you're moving around with your device. However, there are <a href=#>things you can do to reduce wireless interference and get the best&nbsp;Wi-Fi signal possible</a>.</p><h2 id=when-does-it-make-sense-to-use-ethernet>When Does&nbsp;It Make Sense to Use Ethernet?</h2><p>We don't mean to come down too hard on Wi-Fi. It's pretty speedy, super convenient, and perfectly serviceable for most of what we do on our networks. For one thing, Wi-Fi is essential if you've got mobile devices --- lugging around a cellphone connected to an Ethernet cable would be terrible. Also, there are times you just can't use Ethernet. Maybe it's too difficult to run a permanent, out-of-the-way cable to the location you want. Or maybe your landlord won't allow you to run cables the way you want to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And that's the real reason to use Wi-Fi: convenience. If a device needs to move around or you just don't want to run a cable to it,&nbsp;Wi-Fi is the right choice.</p><p>On the other hand, if you have a desktop PC or server that sits in a single place, Ethernet may be a good option. If you want better quality streaming (especially if you're doing it from a media server on your network) or if you're a gamer, Ethernet will be the way to go. Assuming it's easy enough to plug the devices in with an Ethernet cable, you'll get a more consistently solid connection.</p><p>Gaming is one of those cases where it is always better to use Ethernet if you can.</p><h2 id=wi-fi-vs-ethernet-for-gaming>Wi-Fi vs. Ethernet for Gaming</h2><p>Gaming is --- more than most activities --- extremely sensitive to network latency. If you're playing online games and need reaction time to be as quick as possible, you're better off with a wired Ethernet connection. Yes, there will be other latency that factors in along the Internet path between your device and the gaming server, but every little bit helps.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gamers also tend to be<a href=#> sensitive to highly variable latency</a>, and that is another area where Ethernet is better than Wi-Fi for gaming. For example, a ping of 120 milliseconds (ms) isn't great in a game like Fortnite, but a ping that is rapidly fluctuating between 120 ms and 30 ms can be even worse. It is possible to compensate somewhat for a higher-than-ideal ping, but significant variability in latency makes that basically impossible. Ethernet cables reduce or eliminate latency fluctuations due to your local network. It won't stop latency due to your ISP, however.</p><p>As an example, we tested our Wi-Fi 6 network against a Cat6 ethernet. We ran four tests on each, and found the average ping of the wired connection was 16 ms with a <a href=#>jitter</a> of 7 ms. The Wi-Fi connection had an average ping of 60 ms, with a jitter of 20 ms. That would present a very noticeable difference ingame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, Ethernet offers the advantages of better speed, lower latency, and more reliable connections. Wi-Fi offers the advantage of convenience and being good enough for most uses. So, you'll just have to see&nbsp;if any of your devices fit into the categories where Ethernet will make a difference, and then decide whether it will make a big enough difference to <a href=#>run some Ethernet cable</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhpam9ka4Bww8hmnaJlpqh7brHToZyrppWpeqm71makrpuYYq%2BmwNOeqWaho2KubsPIq5ydZZOku6%2Bxwq2gqKZf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
