This American singer is also known as a prolific songwriter, guitarist, and recording artist, whose unique songs are usually full of heartfelt stories full of old myths. In this article, we discuss facts about the rock star’s family, statistics, and assets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bruce Springsteen Biography (Age)</strong></h2><p>Born in New Jersey, USA, with his birth name Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen, Bruce has always had the best times in the music world, starting with the band “The Castiles”, where he was lead singer, and selling over 120 million copies of his albums worldwide, 65 million of which were sold in the USA. Of course, this has also earned him the popular name “The Boss”.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Rick Harrison’s Wife? Is He Gay? Daughter, Height, Family</a></strong></p><p>Bruce was born on September 23, 1949, the son of his parents Douglas Frederick Springsteen, bus driver, and Adele Ann (Zerilli), legal secretary. He is of Irish-Italian descent and grew up in Freehold with his older sister Virginia and a younger sister Pamela Springsteen, now known for her photographic skills and a short career as an actress.</p><p>Bruce’s passion for music began in his teenage years after watching the performance of the Ed Sullivan Show and introducing himself in that role. Shortly thereafter, his mother, who recognized his potential, bought him his first guitar, with which he began his career in the music world.</p><p>1972 was a memorable year for the talented musician as it marked the beginning of his official career in the music world. In that year he became a solo singer-songwriter after being signed to Columbia Records with the help of the famous American record producer and promoter John Hammond, who first introduced him to a talent scout before signing him to the above-mentioned record companies. The following year saw the release of his debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which featured mainly musicians who later became members of the E Street Band. His second album, The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, was released almost immediately after the first album, thanks to its wide acceptance in the global market.</p><p>October 10, 1975, to October 18, 1989, marked a new phase for Bruce. On the one hand, he had the rare opportunity to appear on the covers of Time and Newsweek magazines at the same time, and on the other hand, he got the chance to tour with Amnesty International Human Rights Now! benefit concerts, which took place in various countries such as the USA, England, and France. Bruce then decided to take a break from playing with the E Street Band on October 18, 1989. On March 21, 1994, he won an Oscar for the original song for The Streets of Philadelphia and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 1999. In the same year, he was officially reunited with the E Street Band.</p><p>Bruce Springsteen not only gained much popularity for his musical activities but also received further recognition for his activities in liberal politics. This was even more pronounced during Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, and when Obama won the election, Bruce’s song The Rising became the first song to be played at the victory party. As proof of his strong support for the Obama administration, he opened a show at Obama’s inauguration ceremony, and in return, Obama honored Bruce at the Kennedy Center in 2009 with the words “I may be the President, but he’s ‘The Boss'”. Springsteen even campaigned for the re-election of President Obama in 2012.</p><p>2016 was another remarkable year for the great musician – it was the year he broke his record for US concert-length by performing his third show of a three-night concert at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The concert was even entered into the record books with 34 songs of four hours and one-minute duration. In the same year his autobiography Born to Run, written by Simon and Schuster, was published. He was even awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then US President Barack Obama. Even more about his successes: Bruce announced his new solo show Springsteen on Broadway at New York’s Walter Kerr Theater. The shows marked his Broadway debut.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Crystal Renay Biography, Relationship With Ne-Yo, Quick Facts</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Net Worth</strong></h2><p>With hundreds of film and television show soundtracks, including the popular classic Jerry McGuire, Bruce Springsteen remains one of the most successful and amazing American singers, songwriters, guitarists, poets, and humanitarian people America has ever had.
