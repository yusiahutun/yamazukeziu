Though she’s now an experienced model, the teenager admitted she still has one funny catwalk phobia. “I always get scared — I know this is weird — I get scared I’m gonna sneeze or something during it,” she previously said. “I don’t know why. When I’m walking I’m like, ‘Please do not sneeze.’ That’s my biggest fear.”</p><p>Kelsey, 61, welcomed Mason with his third wife, Camille Grammer, in October 2001. The <a href=#>Frasier</a> star and Camille, 49 — a former Playboy model! — were previously married from 1997 until 2011.</p><p>According to Mason, her parents have been totally in favor of her following in their famous footsteps — so cool! “My dad was actually supportive [of me modeling], which is kind of surprising. But he’s happy for me, and I’ve told him every time I’ve gone [to NYFW] and he’s been really happy for me,” she said. “So that’s good. My mom is supportive about it [too].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kelsey-grammer-mason-grammer.jpg><p>Mason and Kelsey in June 2016.</p><p>Camille — who also has a 13-year-old son, Jude, with Kelsey — loves watching her daughter fulfill her modeling dreams. “I am so proud, she’s a good person, she’s a good girl, in school she’s getting all A’s right now,” Camille said. “She’s been acing every test and we want to reward her with something that she loves and I think it helps her with her self-confidence.”</p><p>As far as Mason’s expectations for her modeling career, she says she’s just playing it by ear. “Just seeing where the road takes us,” she said, adding, “With school, I’ll try to stay on top of it and do the best that I can, ’cause I feel school comes first before any of this. It’s more fun right now and we’ll [see] if anything comes of it, but school is my number one priority.”</p><p><b>Click through the gallery below to see all of Kelsey Grammer’s kids!</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46knKWrla56qL7ApqSeql2Zrrazx62cq2WdlsCwuoygqZqlnZq%2FbrrYn65maWJqfXmBjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
