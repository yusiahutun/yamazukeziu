People who have just met interact a lot as they are eager to learn more about one another. Few maintain the intensity because, with time, they exhaust things to talk about. So, besides the obvious explanation that people sometimes lose interest in a relationship, why do guys text less after a while?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1f748ebe3b041892.jpg><p class=align-left>There is a constellation of justifications for the habit of guys texting less after a while.

Many women have found themselves in situations where their men went from texting every day to nothing within a short time. Men are naturally poor in communication, but there could be many other reasons for this uncanny habit. The common reasons are:</p><h3>1. He is getting comfortable</h3><p class=align-left>You are probably worrying sick that your guy is texting you less and less than how he used to. When you first met, he was under pressure to impress you with regular <a href=#>romantic texts</a>. His hunting instincts were leading him to do all he could to capture your heart.</p><p class=align-left>He'd wake up in the middle of the night just to remind you how beautiful you are, but now that you've become a couple, he may forget even to say good morning! What you need to do is to relax because this could be good news for you. It is not that he is cheating on you or he is bored with you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys stare but never approach me?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It could mean that he is getting comfortable, which is a sign that he is satisfied that the relationship is where it needs to be. The only thing you can do is to ensure he is not getting lazy. Find ways to make him continue putting in the effort to make the relationship last.</p><h3>2. He wants some space</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes you may turn the entire <a href=#>world</a> upside down, looking for answers when they can only be found within you. If a guy is texting less, it is because he wants some space and time. At times like this, you have to be hopeful but also be prepared for the worst.</p><p class=align-left>Needing space is not a sign that he wants to break up, but it is an indication that some things must change for the relationship to get back to where it was before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8b6a9c4ebf2550e6.jpg><p class=align-left>The pertinent question to ask yourself here is, why would a guy want some space? Is it you or him? It could be that he is having a lot of stress at work, or you may be the one putting him under a lot of pressure. Most often, when the things causing him stress are resolved, he will get back to texting you as often as he used to.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f39ac4e902a235e4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>My girlfriend has a celebrity crush: Should I be worried?</span></p></a><h3>3. Your texts could be overwhelming him</h3><p class=align-left>Guys put up with a lot without revealing what they are going through. Sometimes you will see that he is always online but not talking to you. You can't order a firing squad on him before finding out why he seems to be avoiding you. Since you know well that he is not busy because he is online, what else could make him text less?</p><p class=align-left>The answer is usually simple than you think. You have clearly overwhelmed him with your texting habit. Perhaps you are the kind of person who doesn't stop texting once you start, and he feels that he should do a few things before chatting with you. It could also be that you engage him on topics he is not comfortable discussing.</p><h3>4. There is an issue in the relationship</h3><p class=align-left>There is always a big elephant in the room when a guy slows down communication, but you have chosen not to acknowledge it. Your man is pulling away because of an<a href=#> unresolved relationship</a> issue.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/30fb47cab9fc697b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>She stopped texting me out of nowhere! 8 possible reasons why</span></p></a><p class=align-left>All is not lost if he texts you, even if it is not as much as he used to. It means he wants things to work out. However, this does not call for celebration because the reduced frequency also means he may have lost some of the love he had.</p><p class=align-left>Perhaps he discovered that the relationship was moving too fast and wanted to cool things down. He only wants to ensure he is ready before he can commit. It could also be that you did something wrong, and he is unhappy about it. To return to the way things were before, you must acknowledge your mistake and apologize.</p><h3>5. He has found someone</h3><p class=align-left>Dating is no longer what it used to be in the old days. In the past, couples would be in courtship for a long time without worrying that one would leave along the way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg><p class=align-left>That is not the case nowadays because people seem to be in a hurry in all spheres of life, including dating. Furthermore, nowadays, people want to explore new things and hence move from one relationship to another within a short time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The advancement in technology does not help when it comes to people being faithful. There are many <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/guides/468669-what-mchat-7-downloading-app/ href=#>dating apps</a> which enable guys to text several women at the same time. If he finds someone he thinks is worth dating, he will definitely cut communication with you. This could be the reason he is not texting you as much as he used to.</p><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><li>What does it mean when a guy slows down texting you?
