Want to replace your tail light assembly and don’t know how to do it? A faulty tail light can be hazardous and misleading which is why any issue should be resolved immediately. This is apart from the fact that driving without headlights is a traffic violation. If you need help with tail light problems your best bet is to ask an Expert.</p><p>Read below where Experts have provided answers to Mazda tail light questions.</p><h2>How to fix the tail lights of a Mazda 3 which have stopped working?</h2><p>If both tail lights have stopped working then the fuse has probably blown. Check the 15 amp fuse in the fuse box below the hood. If only one light does not work then it is more likely to be a blown bulb which needs to be replaced. If the bulb and is good, then the most likely possibility is a wiring problem which will need to be traced and fixed.</p><h2>Why does one tail light on a Mazda Protégé remain on all the time even when the lights have been switched off?</h2><p>If only one light is not working the problem is likely to be a short in the wiring harness. Since the wiring of both tail lights are bunched together in a single circuit, a problem with the relay or switch can be ruled out. The only way to locate the short is to trace the wiring harness from the non-working light all the way to the front of the vehicle. Look for a wire that is cut, frayed or burnt which will need to be repaired.</p><h2>How to troubleshoot a Mazda CX-7 with tail lights which do not work but brake lights which do?</h2><p>Check the fuse, and if that has not blown, then the problem is likely to be a faulty headlight switch.</p><h2>Why does a Mazda Protégé tail light remain on though the switch is turned off?</h2><p>Assuming the switch has no issue then the other likely problem area is a defective TNS relay. If that is also good then, in all probability, there is a fault in the wiring. Here is a wiring diagram which illustrates the circuits.</p><p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/supermazdatech/2012-04-16_205534_tns.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>How does one remove a Mazda CX-7 tail light assembly for replacement?</h2><p>Inside the back hatch area there is a panel which covers the bolts which secure the tail light assembly. Remove this panel, then remove the cover below it and undo the 10mm nuts which secure the assembly. Once they are out, the light can be pushed from behind and pulled out.</p><h2>How does one remove the tail lights of a Mazda 6?</h2><p>From the inside remove the plastic trim which is secured by plastic clips. To do this a special trim stock will be required which is available at most auto stores for a few dollars. The panel just pops out of these clips. The tail light assembly is fixed to the panel with two nuts which will need to be undone.</p><h2>How to troubleshoot a Mazda 626 where the tail lights and dash lights don’t work?</h2><p><strong>Case Details: The tail lights come on when the signal indicator is operated, or when the high beam is used.</strong></p><p>This is evidently not a relay or fuse problem so it’s most likely to be a defective combination switch which is housed within the steering column. The switch is a single unit which operates multiple features including the lights. To access the multi-function or combination switch, the steering wheel will need to be removed. This requires a special steering wheel puller which can be rented from certain auto stores.</p><h2>How to fix the tail and dash lights of a Mazda Miata which don’t work, but makes a click from under the dash, when the switch is turned on?</h2><p>When the tail lights and dash lights don’t work it usually points to a defective switch. Sometimes these lights may work intermittently. The solution is to replace the switch.</p><p>Tail lights are an essential safety feature so any problem needs to be attended to immediately. While most tail light issues are simple to diagnose, locating the source is more difficult, especially if caused by a wiring fault. If you face a tail light issue on which you need help, ask an Expert. Verified Experts are always ready to address tail light problems.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7q8HSrZinq6eav2%2BvzqZmraegnrC0edOaoKVlnJ60qcCMppiznJFk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
