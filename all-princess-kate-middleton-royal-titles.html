And the list keeps growing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With Queen Elizabeth II’s passing, Kate was given a whole new set of titles, as the monarch’s death spurred a major shift in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a41136631/william-kate-prince-princess-wales/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="British line of succession" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">British line of succession</a>. And in December 2022, the princess <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a42317710/princess-kate-middleton-new-title-belonged-prince-william/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="took over a title" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">took over a title</a> that had once belonged to her husband, Prince William, marking her first appointed role in the British Army.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, see a complete breakdown of all the official titles the Princess of Wales has had throughout her years in the British royal family.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Royal Titles</h2><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Princess of Wales</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a38038396/queen-elizabeth-ii-died-age-96/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="death of Queen Elizabeth" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">death of Queen Elizabeth</a> on September 8, 2022, Kate graduated from duchess to princess and was named the new Princess of Wales, alongside William, who is now Prince of Wales. Kate inherited the title from her late mother-in-law, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/g22549179/princess-diana-life-facts/?slide=1" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Diana" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Princess Diana</a>, who was married to Prince Charles—now King Charles III—from 1981 to 1996.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While Kate is colloquially referred to as Princess Catherine or Princess Kate, her formal royal name is actually Catherine, Princess of Wales. Like Princess Diana (technically Diana, Princess of Wales), Kate was not born into the British royal family, meaning her first name precedes, rather than follows, her title, per the peerage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In rank, princess falls directly below queen consort, the title Kate will likely inherit from Camilla Parker Bowles (now Camilla, Queen Consort) when William accedes to the throne.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Duchess of Cambridge</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Upon marrying Prince William in 2011, Kate was officially named Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Cambridge. It was her first and is her longest-held role. She retains the title today, despite her ascension to Princess of Wales.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Duchess of Cornwall</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate additionally inherited another duchess title from Camilla following Queen Elizabeth’s death and King Charles’s subsequent accession. As with Wales, the Cornwall title is a courtesy title in direct line for the rank of king and queen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate held on to her old and new duchess titles, and was officially known as the Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge for a single day on September 8—which marked the brief period between Queen Elizabeth’s death and Charles’s confirmation as new king of the United Kingdom, after which she became Princess of Wales.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Duchess of Rothesay and Countess of Chester</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate’s regional princess titles in Scotland are Duchess of Rothesay and Countess of Chester—both of which were inherited from Camilla and are exclusively linked to the heir apparent to the throne—per the nation’s long-standing nobility system.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prior to becoming a princess, Kate was known in Scotland as the Countess of Strathearn and still holds that title as well.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Countess of Carrick and Baroness of Renfrew</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate’s regional titles in Northern Ireland are Countess of Carrick and Baroness of Renfrew. Though she was still only a duchess, she was known in the U.K. sovereign nation as Lady Carrickfergus.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Military Titles</h2><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Colonel of the Irish Guards</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This military title was Kate’s first honorary appointment in the British Army with the Irish Guards regiment. She inherited the title in December 2022 from Prince William, who has since been named the new Colonel of the Welsh Guards. The princess is the first woman and second-ever royal behind William to assume the honorary military role.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Commodore-in-Chief of the Fleet Air Arm</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate was given the title on August 11, 2023, by King Charles, to “reflect the close relationship between the Armed Forces and the Royal Family in His Majesty’s reign.” The Fleet Air Arm is the naval aviation component of the United Kingdom’s Royal Navy. Commodore-in-chief is an honorary appointment bestowed by the monarch of the Commonwealth on certain members of the royal family.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Colonel-in-Chief of the 1st Queen’s Dragoon Guards</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate was given the title on August 11, 2023, by King Charles.

It is one of the oldest regiments in the British Army and the most senior.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Royal Honorary Air Commodore of the R.A.F. Coningsby</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kate was given the title on August 11, 2023, by King Charles.

The Air Cadets is a volunteer-military youth organization sponsored by the Royal Air Force.</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Other Titles</h2><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Patron of Rugby</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On Queen Elizabeth’s orders, Kate was named the royal patron of the Rugby Football Union and Rugby Football League—a position formerly held by Prince Harry, prior to his 2020 resignation from senior royal duties—in February 2022.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The princess has since visited Twickenham Stadium and met with England’s men’s and women’s teams at practice and training sessions for the Six Nations Championship. Per a Kensington Palace press release, the role has closely aligned with her “long-standing passion for sport and the lifelong benefits it can provide, both within our communities and on an individual level.”</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Sponsor of HMS Glasgow</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">HMS Glasgow is the first of the Royal Navy’s new type 26 frigates and is currently under construction.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
