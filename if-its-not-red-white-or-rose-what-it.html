Rosé wines are made from red-wine grapes and their pink hue is the result of the juice’s brief contact with the skins of the grapes from which they are pressed. Red grapes become red wine due to prolonged maceration of the liquid with the grape skin.</p><p datatype="p" id=U10556069551wZF class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>The longer a winemaker leaves the juice in contact with the skin, the deeper the colour of the wine. It’s a delicate balance – too long, and the wine could have more bitter tannins than intended. Another factor that can affect colour is the thickness of the grape skin – pinot noir, for example, which is mainly found in cool to moderate climates, is at the thin-skinned end of the scale, with shiraz/syrah on the thick-skinned side because the grape does best in warmer to hot climates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/images/methode/2016/07/27/fc8de700-4f0b-11e6-ba91-9b331c0ddad9_236x.JPG?itok=p7iJphmL">Orange wines are made from white-wine grapes using the same methodology as red-wine production. That is, pressing the grapes and letting them sit with the skins for up to two weeks while fermenting. Why? To give them tannins, more colour – that eye-catching orange hue – and an interesting, slightly funky nose with a mildly bitter apple ciderish zip. This technique is used to allow the wine to age more like a red. Georgia, Slovenia and Lebanon have been the traditional homes of orange wines.<p datatype="p" id=U10556069551ueB class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>The best examples available in Hong Kong are from the Movia Winery, in the Brda region in Slovenia, and have been made by the Kristancic family since 1820. My favourite drop is their rebula (ribolla in Italian); the name comes from the word ribollire, which means to reboil, a process the wine goes through in the spring, when the weather warms up and fermentation begins again.</p><p datatype="p" id=U10556069551w1H class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>The wine has a warm amber colour verging on tawny for older vintages, and lovely salty goose­berry and dried currant flavours with a touch of pine needles and oak.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/07/27/a0fc396a-53c9-11e6-98ca-49b1c9e3ed10_486x.JPG?itok=5n5SH1uz">The white wines of Serge Hochar’s famed Chateau Musar, in Lebanon, are also incredibly long-lived. Hochar made his wines in this time-honoured style and released them when he thought they were ready to drink. I remember sharing a 1988 from him that was, on first sight, rather alarmingly orange and looked rather oxydised when it was poured. I was sceptical but, to be polite, I took a tentative sip, and was immediately hooked on its creamy textures, with dried honey and intense<br>citrusy flavours. It was old, yes, and it was delicious. The indigenous grapes in the wine were ancient varieties found only in Lebanon – obaideh (considered a progenitor to chasselas and chardonnay) and merwah (related to semillon).<p datatype="p" id=U10556069551EGG class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>And what to pair with orange wine? Almost anything goes, and they are very compatible with dishes that have intense flavours – spicy food, slow-cooked cassoulet and lamb come to mind.</p><p datatype="p" id=U105560695518SE class="c2 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Orange wines are best decanted in advance and served slightly chilled.</p><p datatype="p" id=U10556069551Am class="c4 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>Nellie Ming Lee is a food stylist and part-time sommelier studying with the Court of Master Sommeliers.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: The new black</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtoZOhsnB9mHJsbXFoZLanecitqmamn6l6s7HDZq6hoaSaerC%2BjKumrJ1drLWiwIyiqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
