The star can be seen wearing a red leather blazer dress, paired with black tights and stilettos.</p><p>Nicola and Brooklyn, who recently <a href=#>mourned a tragic loss</a>, have been married for just over a year, and have been dating since 2019.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-think-nicola-s-choice-of-pictures-are-strange>Fans think Nicola’s choice of pictures are ‘strange’</h2><p>Although the documentary has had fans hooked to their <a href=#>TV</a> across the globe, Peltz’s post was not one for fans to come together and talk about the show.</p><p>In fact, her comments have been bombarded with fans declaring it ‘strange’ congratulating her father in law by posting ‘raunchy pictures’ with his son.</p><p>“You set up a camera to take raunchy pics with your husband to congratulate his dad? [thinking emoji]” questioned one confused fan.</p><p>Another penned: “Very strange photos for congratulating your father-in-law.”</p><p>One fan even went as far as unfollowing the star after seeing the post: “Unfollowed. Sorry super odd. Congratulations Beckham the legend. The rest in this post is uncomfortable.”</p><p>“Weird choice and/or order of pictures to congratulate your father-in-law, one might say [laughing emojis]” wrote another.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2WCcLrInKalmV2lsq3A2Waaq52VpcBuu9StZJ%2BZnqh6uLXToWSrmaWjsKnFjKmfqKyfqHqkscuemauZpJ67qHnHnqlmnpGptaa%2BjKKlZqSRrHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
