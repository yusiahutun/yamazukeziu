This morning my family experienced the tragic loss of my father, Dick, and mother, Joan.

My parents were always there for their children, from the days my Dad coached us as kids and my Mom would work the concession stands, through to this morning. The most important part of their 56 years of marriage was providing opportunities to their children,” he continued.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/doug-flutie-6.jpg><p>Doug in November 1998.</p><p>“They were incredible parents and Grandparents and my family and I will miss them both.
