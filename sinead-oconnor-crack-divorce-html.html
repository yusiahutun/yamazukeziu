Dressed in a pink strapless wedding gown which showed many of her tattoos Sinead was glowing with happiness and smiles as the pair wed in one of the most famous wedding chapels. The likes of Elvis and Britney Spears have all wed at this chapel and Sinead has now followed in their footsteps. The ceremony lasted about 15 minutes and the pair seemed absolutely head over heals with each other, commenting that they wouldnt be out and about in the casino on their wedding night but still gambling none the less.

Barry was very frightened — that kind of messed everything up a bit really.” Crack <i>is</i> whack, but who knew finding marijuana in Las Vegas was so difficult? O’Connor says that she “wasn’t scared” during the exchange, but that it killed her relationship: Her soon-to-be-ex “is a drugs counselor,” she says. “What was I thinking?” Aw, can’t these crazy kids work things out?</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Sun UK</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Sinead O’Connor Blames Marriage Dissolution on Accidental Crack Purchase</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloamdhZ3y0tc2emJ1ln5i8r7rOq2ScqpGYuG6wyK%2Bmq5uVY7W1ucs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
