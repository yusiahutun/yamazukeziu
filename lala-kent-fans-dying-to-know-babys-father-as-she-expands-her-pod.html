The Vanderpump Rules star shared the exciting news via social media. Reality star Lala was previously in a relationship with film producer and director Randall Emmett. The two welcomed their first child together in 2021. Now, Lala’s baby announcement three years later has people wondering who the father is.</strong></p><p>Almost 10 years ago, <a href=#>Lala Kent</a> joined the cast of <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> in season 5. The 33-year-old still appears on the <a href=#>reality TV</a> series today, starring alongside her pals James Kennedy, Scheana Shay, and <a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2024/03/GettyImages-1326383037-683x1024.jpg><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lala-kent-s-baby-father>Lala Kent’s baby father</h2><p>After getting engaged to Randall Emmett in 2018, Lala and her then-fiancé had plans to get married two years later but never did.</p><p>The two went their separate ways in 2021 and during her singledom, Lala decided she “didn’t want more baby fathers,” something she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a> on the Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast in 2021.</p><p>Despite this, she’s revealed via IG she’s “expanding her pod” and is expecting her second child.

I think if there’s a will, there’s a way. I knew a donor was an option, and I knew IUI was an option.”</p><p>When it came to finding the correct person to expand her family, Lala explained how it wasn’t a quick process: “It took a really long time to find the donor because, you know, it’s strange….</p><p>“It’s like you’re shopping for your partner but only to have a child, so there’s a lot that goes into it. But the moment I found this donor, it just spoke to me. He felt like my baby daddy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lala Kent (@lalakent)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-donor-has-changed-my-life>‘Donor has changed my life’</h2><p>In her interview with Cosmopolitan, Lala explained how she “gets emotional talking about” her journey because the “donor has changed her life.”</p><p>She said: “My whole thing with this process is that I want to take the stigma away from those getting a donor but also from men who donate…”</p><p>The Vanderpump Rules star added how she “never thought it was a road she would be going down.</p><p>She added: “I really saw myself in the cookie-cutter relationship and creating a family, but now that the universe has other plans for me, I’m so grateful this was an option.”</p><p>WATCH VANDERPUMP RULES AT 8 PM ON BRAVO ON TUESDAYS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfo7K4v46lmKWZXaCyr8CMn5inq12Zxqq6xmarqGWbo7y4ecGambKrXZuutbTEq2Saq12otaZ5xLGnmqaUqHqpsdFmp6ic</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
