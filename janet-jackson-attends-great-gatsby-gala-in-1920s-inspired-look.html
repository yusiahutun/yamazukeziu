The “Rhythm Nation” singer wore her best 1920s-esque outfit when she attended the Great Gatsby Gala in London on Thursday, January 30.</p><p>Janet, 53, showed up on the red carpet with a bunch of pearl necklaces that fell over her beautiful black gown. She also had a gorgeous black fur coat which paired nicely with a black hat and black gloves. The iconic dancer completed the look with a dark shade of lipstick which would have certainly captured The Great Gatsby author <strong>F. Scott Fitzgerald</strong>‘s attention — if he was alive today, that is.</p><p>If you ask us, the “That’s the Way Love Goes” musician can rock anything — and it’s all because of her amazing figure. However, she admits there used to be a time when she wasn’t so confident about her body. Like most people, Janet had to <a href=#>learn how to love herself.</a></p><p>“I had to find something in my body that I loved, and that was difficult for me to do,” the five-time Grammy winner once told <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">InStyle</a>. “At first, I couldn’t find anything. I would look in the mirror and start crying. I didn’t like that I was not attractive. I didn’t like anything about me. But I wound up falling in love with the small of my back. And then from there I found more things.”</p><p>It also helped that Janet — who is mom to son <strong>Eissa Al Mana</strong>, 3, with ex <strong>Wissam Al Mana</strong> — was getting wiser with age. “A lot of it has to do with experience, getting older. Understanding, realizing that there isn’t just one thing that is considered beautiful. Beautiful comes in all shapes, sizes, and colors,” she continued. “It’s vulnerability. It’s power. It’s confidence. It’s happiness. It’s seeing the goodness in the soul. It’s spirituality. It’s being selfless and what you do for others before doing for yourself.”</p><p>Amen to that.</p><p><strong>Scroll below to see pictures of Janet looking as gorgeous as ever on the red carpet!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jmKedpGK3oq%2FKrKanZZGpwaa6w6xkoKqVlsFus8CtqpuxXZyura2MoqVmaWlnfbR5yKeqqaGimrFuuM6oomg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
