Do you remember that one scene in the film after Patrick Swayze dies and they haven’t figured out that Carl is the villain yet? He comes over to Molly’s apartment, and it’s like this soaring SoHo loft, the kind that doesn’t exist anymore. So, he comes over and brings her a paper bag full of pears, and he goes, “I brought you those Japanese pears that you like.” I don't know why, but that scene always stuck with me and was just so atmospheric.</p><img alt=ghost title=Ghost width=1024 height=686 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-actors-demi-moore-and-patrick-swayze-on-the-set-of-news-photo-1712336015.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sunset Boulevard</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Actors Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze in Ghost</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I always wondered what that particular scene smelled like, with the pears and New York City in the ’90s, pre-cell-phone, pre-social-media, Demi Moore with her ceramics tucked away. And I also have always really loved pear—it’s such a magical fruit. It means so much to so many people around the world. In Japan, they plant pear trees in front of their homes as a symbol of protection for the families. In China, they’re a symbol of prosperity and abundance. And in Greece, they call them a gift from the gods.</p><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sephora.com/product/nette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711?skuId=2736205" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action data-vars-ga-product-id=7d3222e9-2af7-4665-912c-e736a6315d11 rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.sephora.com/product/nette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711?skuId=2736205" data-product-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/nette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711?skuId=2736205" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fnette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711%3FskuId%3D2736205&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c919a546-ae14-41b0-a157-758886285c2c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689251","merchant_name":"Sephora.com, Inc.","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fnette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711%3FskuId%3D2736205&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fnette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711%3FskuId%3D2736205&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2024-04-08 14:15:43.335849"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=eaa2e4f3-fd19-44d2-989b-035f73b250bc class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><img alt=nette title=Nette width=1200 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2024-04-05-at-1-59-16-pm-661076848000d.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nette</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s a very revered fruit symbolically across the world, and I’ve always been sort of obsessed with how people think about the pear, and how it would be so interesting to have this Asian pear as the centerpiece of a perfume and have it be symbolically a perfume for protection, abundance, and then very much scientifically, a perfume for joy. That’s the brief that I gave Rodrigo—and the genius that he is, he took that insanity and turned it into what Pear Jam is today.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How did you two work together to bring these ideas to life?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Flores-Roux: </strong>This project was a lot of fun. We enjoyed every step of it and put a lot of detail into the fragrance, and that’s the kind of work I love to do: when you don’t leave a single stone unturned and explore all possibilities. The fragrance was lending itself to a lot of dialogue; Carol came to us with a very clear idea, and that assertiveness was very helpful. Pear was very clear in our conversations from the beginning, so we decided to focus on that.</p><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sephora.com/product/nette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action data-vars-ga-product-id=30446bec-1c08-47a2-b6ee-cc4da836e8a0 rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.sephora.com/product/nette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711 data-product-url=https://www.sephora.com/product/nette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fnette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c919a546-ae14-41b0-a157-758886285c2c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689251","merchant_name":"Sephora.com, Inc.","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fnette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fnette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2024-04-08 14:15:43.425726"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$120.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ef0fe7ca-64d9-4592-82ad-04f1c0e5dd69 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><img alt="nette pear jam" title="Nette Pear Jam" width=1336 height=1338 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nette-1-6610389a3ce3c.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nette</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, I started working on a pear accord based on koji, a Japanese pear, and realized that when you take a bite, there’s this beautiful water—almost like a nectar—that flows out of the fruit. And then the flesh of the pear is also very specific, because it has this graininess or sandiness that’s pleasant to the mouth. So, those for me were some of the important things that we wanted to communicate through this fragrance. The moment you spray it, you know its top note of pear accord is there.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, there’s also a little bit of jasmine, rose, and patchouli, but the hook is this kind of fleshy pear and nectar kind of story. Once Carol told me the name of the fragrance was going to be called Pear Jam, I thought that was very important. It was not all about the lightness, wateriness, and freshness of the scent, but also something tasty and sweet to anchor it with. We constructed this jamminess: It’s very light, uplifting, and happy—there’s nothing dark about it. Then at the very end, I used a very specific molecule that comes from the flavor department that’s called a fruit jam key tone, which adds to the theme of a pot of jelly or jam. We also discovered that it was the first time it’s ever been used in a fragrance, which is a nice claim for Pear Jam.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Han Pyle: </strong>It’s actually scientifically proven to boost feelings of happiness and well-being, and it’s certified, as well, to do those things—that was really important to us. And just to reiterate Rodrigo’s note about that raspberry pulp key tone that lends to its jamminess, that was a brilliant finishing brushstroke that Rodrigo added in our very last mod that we did of the fragrance. And it just added—exactly what he was saying—this jammy quality to Pear Jam that was not there before in all of the other iterations that we did, and I just think it makes it so special. I feel really lucky that we’re the only fragrance brand that has used that particular ingredient.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Could you describe a little of the science behind Pear Jam’s mood-boosting benefits?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Flores-Roux: </strong>We used an AI instrument that takes a look at the combination of raw materials which go through a calculation regarding how they relate to the human brain. You feel moods of happiness and relaxation with Pear Jam, and this was also important to Carol in the beginning, because in these modern times, customers want a fragrance with added benefits.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Pear Jam’s 50 ml design also reveals the first of Nette’s next generation of bottle aesthetics. Can you speak about your decision to add a color-pop detail to each of your scents moving forward?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Han Pyle: </strong>Yes, we’re redesigning all of our larger perfume bottles to have colors painted on the bottom that relate directly to each of the fragrances, and that’s rolling out over the next couple of months. I think we try to convey the feeling of each of our fragrances at every single touchpoint. We want our fragrances to be able to help our community take good care of themselves and really use them for an uplifting benefit throughout their days. And we also want to convey the feeling behind every fragrance through both art and science.</p><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.sephora.com/product/nette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action data-vars-ga-product-id=30446bec-1c08-47a2-b6ee-cc4da836e8a0 rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.sephora.com/product/nette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711 data-product-url=https://www.sephora.com/product/nette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fnette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c919a546-ae14-41b0-a157-758886285c2c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689251","merchant_name":"Sephora.com, Inc.","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","metadata":{}},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fnette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=2417&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fnette-pear-jam-eau-de-parfum-P510711&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2024-04-08 14:15:43.425726"}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$120.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ef0fe7ca-64d9-4592-82ad-04f1c0e5dd69 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><img alt=nette title=Nette width=1200 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2024-04-05-at-1-59-28-pm-661071be2f142.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Nette</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We do this through the poems that are printed on our perfume bottles, and each one of our candles also has a poem on their labels to try and convey the feeling behind the scent. Of course, we also do that with our perfumes with this mood-boosting technology that’s really infused into every single one of our fragrances. I felt like color was a missing link; color is able to also affect mood and emotion, and convey, I think, the feeling of a fragrance in a really powerful way. Like, for example, Pear Jam: Pears aren’t pink, right? They’re green or yellow or brown, but I really felt like this particular fragrance was a pink pear fragrance because of ingredients like raspberry pulp and rose—I just felt the sweet, happy, cheerful, jamminess of it. We led with that color, really just to make sure that people know that this doesn’t smell like an unripe green pear, it smells jammy, luscious, and mouthwatering. To me, the color pink accurately reflects that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Flores-Roux: </strong>It really rounds out the entire concept very beautifully.<strong></strong><br></p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Definitely. Would you say this scent is designed for fruit-forward fragrance lovers or the fruit-averse?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Flores-Roux: </strong>The fragrance can be perceived as more feminine than not, but it wears very nicely on guys, too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Han Pyle: </strong>I agree! Upon first spritz, there’s this happy juiciness, like it’s a very photorealistic pear, but I think as it dries out, it does get more androgynous.
