As you might expect, the application is fairly tedious. “The extensions are carefully applied one at a time using a specially-formulated, semi-permanent glue that will not irritate or damage the natural lash,” she adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike false eyelashes, where the strip or individual lashes are applied to the skin, lash extensions are attached directly to the lash itself. The results are more lush, dense lashes that may even let you skip mascara (gasp).</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Are There Different Types of Eyelash Extensions?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Wayne, there are different lash styles, to achieve different lengths, curls, and overall lash looks. "The most common lash sets are Classic, Hybrid, Volume, and Mega Volume," she says. "Lashes extensions come in various different lengths, curl types, diameters, and textures." They also come in different materials. "Most lashes are made of a synthetic plastic material to mimic the look and feel of mink, cashmere or silk," says the pro.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Do Eyelash Extensions Look Natural?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The final look is meant to enhance your natural lashes with more length, fullness, and lift. Whether that look is more dramatic or more natural is up to the client, but generally, the more lashes applied, the more dramatic the effect. A typical treatment involves anywhere from 80-140 individual extensions per eye, with lashes ranging in length from 6-18mm, according to Richardson. “It’s not one size fits all,” she explains. “For instance, if you have damaged lashes, or naturally weak, short natural lashes, it’s not always possible to get a more dramatic look that a client with stronger, thicker lashes can achieve.”</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Long Does the Process Take?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The bad news? Expect the treatment to take one to two hours, depending on your desired look. The good news? You can use it as an excuse to lie down, relax, and take a forced break from your phone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A good lash technician will take their time, reminds Richardson. “Safety should be your number-one concern. Finding someone who is certified to apply the lashes is a must. Depending on the state, the stylist also needs to be licensed,” she advises.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Much Do Eyelash Extensions Cost?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cost varies depending on the location, technician, and the final look. At Envious Lashes, a starter set is $105, and “Bombshells”—a favorite of Richardson’s celeb clients like Mary J. Blige—cost upwards of $550. Longer lashes are both a time and financial commitment, and could potentially cost you thousands of dollars per year depending on how often you get them filled.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Do You Care for Lash Extensions?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Avoid water for the first day or so until the glue has a chance to fully dry. Treat your new lashes with TLC—don't curl them, slap on mascara, or rub your eyes. Basically, avoid anything that requires you to touch your lashes, and stay away from oil-based products and cleansers as well. Mascara can be applied to just the tips of lashes if you'd like, but it's best to skip it all together. After all, your new lashes should be dramatic enough on their own.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How Long Do Eyelash Extensions Last?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because extensions are attached to the lash itself, they last as long as the natural growth cycle, or about six weeks. To extend the life of the extensions, Richardson recommends using a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.enviouslashboutique.com/consumer-products/envious-lashes-conditioning-luxuriating-lash-serum.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lash conditioner " class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>lash conditioner </u></a>(yes, it exists!) and to gently comb through your lashes with a dry spoolie brush. She also recommends getting “refills” every two to three weeks to fill in any sparse areas.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Are There Any Downsides to Getting Lash Extensions?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like many beauty treatments, Wayne says, "The biggest downside is how pricey and addicting they can be. Once you get started on lash extensions sometimes it's hard to go back." The pro adds that getting extensions is "like literally waking up in your makeup."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The maintenance can also be a surprise to some. "Regular, two-week fills are required to keep them looking good and maintained," says Wayne. "With that said, lash extensions are a financial investment. A good lash artist isn't cheap, and if lash extensions are not attached properly, or if too many are on and they are too heavy for the natural lashes, they can prematurely make lashes fall out and damage the lash line." Therefore, she stresses that "Choosing a good lash artist is crucial."</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Do Lash Extensions Inhibit Natural Lash Growth?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With proper care, lashes should continue to grow normally. However, Wayne warns that "If the client doesn't follow proper aftercare, "premature lash shedding can occur."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Finding a qualified lash technician is just as important. "As long as you take care of the extensions and go to a highly trained and experienced lash tech, your lashes maintain their health," says Wayne, who recommends using a lash serum for added nourishment.

"DIY lash cluster or strip lashes, using a growth serum, and mascara naturally extend the length and volume of lashes," says Wayne.
