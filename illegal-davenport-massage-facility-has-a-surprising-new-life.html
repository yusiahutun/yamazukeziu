Jason Smith with Davenport Police.</p><p>City council members passed an ordinance in march that gave officers like him the authority to check up on those business complaints.</p><p>“Ultimately this ordinance [is] to make sure that people aren’t being taken advantage of. That these women aren’t being turned into victims at these massage parlors,” Lt. Smith says.</p><p>Police are teaming up with Family Resources’ Braking Traffik program to make sure survivors get help.</p><p>“They were getting them the resources, places to stay, bank accounts to make sure that they were safe and not being targeted,” Lt. Smith says.</p><p>And in a turn of events a building that was once a concern for sex trafficking is now a place that helps combat it.</p><p>“A portion of everything from here goes towards giving them a safe haven,” DeSalvo says.</p><p>He and his wife founded an organization in 2004 called <a href=#>The Home of Grace </a>to help sexual abuse and assault survivors.</p><p>“What this place used to be, this building, to what it’s now funding– it’s a great turn,” DeSalvo says.</p><p>A spokesperson for Family Resources tells Local 4 News that they have seen an increase in survivors since Davenport’s ordinance was adopted in March.</p><p><a href=#>Police say there’s a loophole in the ordinance that lets some business owners open another massage facility under a different name and go back to breaking the law.</a></p><p>A new amendment was discussed at tonight’s committee of the whole meeting to close those ordinance gaps.</p><p>It could take up to six weeks to pass.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKClpJWcrq15w5qtnqagpL%2B1ecyaqqyZl5p6p63CoqOirKlitaK%2FjJpkrK2ipb%2Bqv8innmamlax6rbXFnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
