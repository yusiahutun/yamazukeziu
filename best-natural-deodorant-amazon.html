I’ve suffered from excessive <a href=# id=auto-tag_sweating data-tag=sweating>sweating</a> since I was a young child, and while the problem primarily manifests itself in my hands and feet, sweaty and smelly underarms have also been a life-long issue of mine. For years and years, I would apply my clinical-strength antiperspirant-<a href=# id=auto-tag_deodorant data-tag=deodorant>deodorant</a> hybrid up to three times a day to keep pits feeling fresh and odor-free. However, when it occurred to me that clogging the ultra-absorbent pores on my underarms with toxic chemicals and aluminum to keep dry was a major health concern that I needed address (some studies have linked these ingredients with cancer) I decided that I had to try a more natural alternative to the traditional products I’d been abusing for over a decade.</p><p>The first time I decided to give <a href=# id=auto-tag_natural-deodorants data-tag=natural-deodorants>natural deodorants</a> a whirl, I was woefully disappointed to say the very least. Not only did the product I chose not even work, but it also caused an uncomfortable underarm rash that lasted over two weeks. Naturally, I didn’t want to give up my non-toxic quest just yet, so I opted for yet another brand to try my luck. While this one didn’t end up with a severe rash after just one use, it left my armpits drenched and stinky within an hour of wear. Well, as the saying goes, the third time was definitely the charm for me. So, before you surrender all hope in finding an effective deodorant that isn’t tainted with all of the bad stuff, check out my favorite non-toxic deodorants that have truly worked for me (and not just for an hour or two).</p><p>STYLECASTER’s mantra is ‘Style To The People’— and our mission is to be an accessible, inclusive, ahead-of-the-trend destination for millennial and Gen Z women who want to live with style and substance.
