For the occasion, Markle flawlessly mixed professionalism and fashion in a super-chic cream suit with a surprising twist that would've made Rachel Zane (Markle's beloved <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=7>Suits</a> character) proud.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the festival, Markle and Prince Harry held the Archewell Foundation Parents’ Summit: Mental Wellness in the Digital Age, marking the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>first ever in-person event</a> for their foundation. Markle arrived to the event, which took place at Hudson Yards in New York City, in an eggshell-colored blazer that folded down on top to create an off-the-shoulder effect. Besides the trendy neckline of the jacket, the piece resembled more traditional blazers with buttons and pockets on either side. She paired the top with wide-leg blazers in a similar shade while beige pointed-toe pumps stayed true to the look's monochromatic nature. I mean, even the chair she sat in on the stage was nearly identical in color (probably an accident, but one can never be too sure when it comes to celebs and royals).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H. Murthy also joined the husband-and-wife duo on the panel, which was moderated by Carson Daly, a board member of Project Healthy Minds. Before the group took the stage, several parents and families shared their stories of strife and tragedy tied to social media and the digitalization of the world. Both Harry and Meghan commended the brave families for recounting the challenges they have faced.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I can’t start without thanking all the parents, the mothers and fathers for being with us physically today, but also being on this journey with us for the last year, creating this community of shared experience,” Harry said to the audience, per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. “We know it’s not easy for you guys to be here so thank you very much."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Toward the end of the panel, Meghan said that as a mother herself, she can't help but be afraid for the future of the digital world but chooses to remain hopeful. "Being a mom is the most important thing in my entire life — outside, of course, being a wife to this one," she lightened the mood by gesturing to her husband Harry. "But I will say I feel fortunate that our children are at an age, again quite young, so this isn't in our immediate future, but I also feel frightened at how it's continuing to change and this will be in front of us."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They say being a parent, the days are long but the years are short, so it worries me, but I'm also given a lot of hope and energy by the progress we've made in the past year being able to have these incredible parents, these survivors of these experiences, share their stories and the more information gathering we're able to do, the more we can move the needle a little bit," she added. "Everyone is affected by the online world and social media. we all just want to feel safe. I'm confident that with more ears and awareness and visibility of what is really happening, we can make some significant change together."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6eoZmeYrqivsqlnGanlpt6tbTEZqqhp6Whsaa%2BjJujmrKVp3qkvsSapGarpZ7Bbq3RnJ%2Ber5WhuW6yzq6lnZmknryvecSvnKesXay8s7jDZqSepqSWuW60xJqjraBdma66ecWeqq2hppa5boSSbXByaWI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
