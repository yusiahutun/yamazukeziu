Strait covered it a decade later for his sophomore album, Strait From the Heart. Released as the third single from the album, "Amarillo by Morning" reached No. 4 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. It has gone on to become one of Strait's signature songs.</p><p><strong>Why Did Brooks & Dunn Break Up, Anyway?</strong></p><p>The lyrics draw a parallel between the life of a rodeo cowboy and the road life of a touring musician.</p><p>"Amarillo by morning / Up from San Antone / Everything that I got is just what I got on / When that sun is high in that Texas sky / I'll be buckin' at the county fair / Amarillo by morning / Amarillo, I'll be there," Dunn sings to begin the track, putting his own unique spin on a song that's also been covered by Chris LeDoux, Asleep at the Wheel and more.</p><p>Dunn's rendition of "Amarillo by Morning" appears on his upcoming <a href=#>Re-Dunn</a> album, which features the iconic county singer re-interpreting country and rock hits from Strait, <a href=#>Tom Petty</a>, <a href=#>Lee Ann Womack</a>, <a href=#>Van Morrison</a> and more.</p><p>â€œThis is a passion project for me," Dunn says in a press release announcing the 24-track project. "If you put together a group of songs that define the soundtrack of my life, this is what it would look like."</p><p>Re-Dunn is set for release in January of 2020. Dunn will release one country song and one rock song every four weeks prior to the album's release. In addition to the Strait cover, Dunn released a cover of the Hollies' "Long Cool Woman (In a Black Dress)" on Friday (Sept. 6).</p><p><strong>50 Essential '90s Country Songs</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq6eeo7amecOupadlkaKus7XLpaZmmqliurC%2BzaKloGWXmryzs8Rmqq2qkZ7Bbq%2FOr5yrZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
