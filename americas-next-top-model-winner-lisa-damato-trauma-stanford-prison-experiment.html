In an explosive new Instagram post, she's encouraging other participants to do the same.</p><p>The former reality star, whose account is private, also claims that Tyra Banks blocked her, per <a href=#>EW</a>, though her other target in her appears to have not blocked her, as she was able to tag producer Ken Mok.

D'Amato first competed in cycle 5 before returning to win the all-stars 17th cycle.</p><p>Her post comes as the show approaches its 20th anniversary on May 20. D'Amato is anticipating heightened awareness and even some nostalgia-based media coverage for the show, which could include interviews with alumnae.</p><p>And so it is to these potential subjects that she penned the bulk of her message, urging them, "Plz plz be honest with yourself and everyone else when I say DON'T BE SCARED to truly tell how horrible it was in your interview."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:00297246-04c0-4452-a672-29d81e323128 data-container-ref=toofab:article:89e4042c-1be5-4151-a2f5-0b15fee59d63 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/08/5by4/2020/05/29/08105bd3713e486e991df3af4d265601_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tyra Banks Opens Up About America's Next Top Model Controversy</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Don't act tough. Be real. Don't be scared of the fandom. Don't be scared of Tyra or Ken Mok," she continued. "The light is coming through and more and more the fandom are on our side."</p><p>"Speak up and speak freely," she emphasized. "Remember this is your life to [sic]! Fight for it! Do you know who is going to stand up for you if you don't? Do you know who is going to save your life if you don't?"</p><p>She wrapped her statement with a comparison to a controversial psychological experiment conducted in 1971 called the Stanford Prison Experiment.</p><p>Intended to be a two-week simulation of what life in prison was like, the experiment was stopped on the sixth day over concerns over how participants chosen to be prison guards were becoming increasingly brutal toward those chosen as prisoners.</p><p>The study had been heavily scrutinized and criticized for ethical concerns and lack of oversight, as well as the fact participants were told they were allowed to leave beforehand, but then told they could not after it had started.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6b23415c-6517-4a36-811f-c64f7d7803e5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:89e4042c-1be5-4151-a2f5-0b15fee59d63 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/05/5by4/2023/03/29/0570dbfffd5142bcb8d5f52203e488a7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tyra Banks Reacts to Julianne Hough Taking Over Her DWTS Hosting Job</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>This is not the first time D'Amato has shared grievances with Banks or "ANTM." She has posted about her alleged concerns before on her Instagram and even spoke out on an episode of "E! True Hollywood Story," which she said was a breach of her contract.</p><p>In a video posted in January 2021, as detailed by <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> at the time, D'Amato said that she knowingly did so "because I felt like it was my duty to warn other girls that were going to audition for 'Americaâ€™s Next Top Model' to know that what you guys do and the way that you guys would poke me and use my childhood trauma against me, day in and day out."</p><p>"It was just so f---ed up, and it broke my heart," she added, tearing up. "Like, how could you do that?" Several other contestants, including Adrianne Curry, Jeana Turner, and Angela Preston, have also spoken out about their alleged negative experiences on the show.</p><p>In May 2020, in response to social media backlash over allegations of bad behavior, Banks' criticism of the gap in cycle 6 winner Danielle Evans' teeth, and controversial episodes that had contestants made up to look like different races, Banks weighed in.</p><p>"Been seeing the posts about the insensitivity of some past ANTM moments and I agree with you," she <a href=#>tweeted</a> at the time. "Looking back, those were some really off choices. Appreciate your honest feedback and am sending you so much love and virtual hugs."</p><a id=gallery-link-02b6bd1e-46c7-4b81-8210-b8db3ec98651 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:02b6bd1e-46c7-4b81-8210-b8db3ec98651 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:89e4042c-1be5-4151-a2f5-0b15fee59d63 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e2/4by3/2023/04/18/e204e68f91044a1aa98e78c4f0036d1c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21ma2lflrqmvsicmKxlnprFtXnTqKdmpZ%2BZsq151qKlp52iYrmqv8Bmm5qlkam8bsDRmqymmV2owaK6xaipnWWgp7a0u81mnLGolae2rrHNrWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
