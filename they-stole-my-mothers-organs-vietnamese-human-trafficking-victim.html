One day, we were taken on a motorbike to a very faraway place,” he recalls. “It was in a very remote mountainous area but they had a very big house with a big farm area.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The scenery may sound idyllic, but this was the beginning of a harrowing journey that stretched from Vietnam to England – and involved exploitation, abuse and pain. Nguyen, now his early 20s, was held captive in Vietnam and then smuggled to Britain, where he was forced to work on cannabis farms and in a restaurant before eventually being rescued by the British authorities.</p>He was among the hundreds of children who were <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">trafficked</span></a> every year from Vietnam to Britain, where the authorities are currently processing his request for asylum.<figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">They said I should keep working very hard, otherwise I would have my organs removed like my mumNguyen, trafficking victim</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nguyen did not learn how to read or write as a child and had to use the harvest seasons and the Chinese New Year celebrations as his time references. So he isn’t sure how old he was when he witnessed a group of men kill his mother.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She had been trying to help him escape the house where they were being held captive when the men caught them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As punishment, his mother’s organs were removed to be sold.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was then taken to another very big house – they all spoke foreign languages, I believe Chinese … In this new house, my job was similar. I was doing cleaning work and cooking,” he recalls. “One day, someone put me on the phone with a Vietnamese voice. It was the security guard of the previous boss saying that I should keep working very hard, otherwise I would have my organs removed like my mum had. I stayed in this house for a few years – I had no idea about time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/c76499d2-17f5-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_1320x770_111714.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nguyen was later told he would work in a foreign country.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The first job I had there [in Britain] was in this house where I had to look after the plants – I only knew where the button to turn on and off the heating was and how many times the plants had to be watered per day,” he recalls, referring to a cannabis farm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the first harvest season, he was moved to another house where there were four other Vietnamese. His job was the same – and if the plants died, he would be beaten up and given no food for days.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nguyen says all he got from several years of work and no freedom were two £5 (US$6.50) notes, and multiple scars covering his face and his malnourished body.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why are Vietnamese risking their lives to reach the UK?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then “they sent me to a restaurant. I was taken there in the evening through a lift to the underground, where I had to do the washing up and prepare whatever the chef told me to,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nguyen slept on a foldable mattress in the corner of the kitchen, where he often faced abuse. He was slapped on the head and one of the chefs slashed his hands with a knife after he broke two plates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After another attempt to escape failed, Nguyen was again taken to a cannabis house, where he stayed until he was rescued by the police last year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/4dd3b98a-1805-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_1320x770_111714.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There were 3,187 Vietnamese adults and children officially identified as potential victims of trafficking in Britain between 2009 and 2018, according to the report “Precarious Journeys” by the non-profit groups Anti-Slavery International, Every Child Protected Against Trafficking and Pacific Links Foundation. For the past few years, Vietnamese have been among the three most at-risk nationalities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But even when victims are rescued, they do not always feel safe.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Grieving Vietnamese struggle to pay to recover dead family from UK</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Vietnamese children comprised the highest number of trafficked and unaccompanied children recorded as going missing from care” in Britain, reads a report by the charities Every Child Protected Against Trafficking and Missing People.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The study notes there are numerous reasons why these children go missing, including a lack of trust in the authorities and carers, the continuing control of a trafficker or exploiter, and fear of immigration controls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/09/076d366a-1805-11ea-9462-4dd25a5b0420_1320x770_111714.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike others, Nguyen has remained in the safe home arranged by the British authorities and hopes to stay in Britain. “The reason I applied for asylum is that I have no family back home and it’s dangerous there,” he says. “If I return, I would probably be taken to the boss [and] they will remove my organs. That’s why I am asking for protection.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now, he is learning English and has attended counselling sessions. “I am living in a safe home. I have better sleep and food to eat. I never thought my life was going to turn into this,” he says. “If I can continue to go to school and have people giving me love instead of torture, I am happy about it.” <span class="tw_sectioncolor css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1><span class="courier css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>■</span></span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">* Nguyen, whose name was shortened to protect his identity, responded through a British-based support worker to a list of written questions sent by This Week in Asia</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2mu8%2BlnGiZoqm2pLjEaGppbGFlf3F706GcsmWjqbytsYymsGaln6m1pr7SZqarn5GjwG7CyJ6rp5mdmsCmeceupJqmXam%2ForLFopqkoZ6cere1wq2gpg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
