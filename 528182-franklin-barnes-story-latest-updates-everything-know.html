He was born in 2000. There are no details about his parents, siblings, early childhood, and educational background. His real name is Franklin Lee Barnes III.</p><h2>Franklin's murder and killings</h2><p class=align-left>In March 2018, it was alleged that<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Franklin shot and killed</a> two men in Arlington. He then drove to Plano and shot four more people, killing one on 29th March. Winston Davis and Joshua Daniels, both 25 at the time, were found shot dead in a car parked at an Arlington apartment complex.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from the Arlington shooting, it is alleged that the two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">victims were robbed</a>, too. A victim's <a href=#>family</a> member said:</p>When they killed him, they took all his jewellery off him. They took all his rings off his hands and took all his jewellery off. They also took Winston's shoes off his feet.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e03a34304c88a95e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Seth Welch and Tatiana Fusari's story: What really happened?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Later, during the same day, another person, Quintarius Young, 29 at the time, was murdered in a shooting at Cross Creek Apartment in Plano. It is alleged that in the Plano apartment complex attacks, Young and his partner were Franklin's target.</p><p class=align-left>After attacking the two victims, he randomly shot two others, making the total number of victims six. Franklin's victims were shot in the face. In addition, there was a higher likelihood that the Arlington victims were targeted because Franklin knew Winston Davis and Joshua Daniels.</p><h2>Arlington's ongoing investigations</h2><p class=align-left>After the dreadful attacks, Franklin was arrested in McKinney a few hours later. Even though the investigation is largely focused on the Plano attacks, the police are working to establish the connection between Franklin and the two murders in an Arlington apartment complex.</p><p class=align-left>When the victim's family were shown Franklin's mugshot, they said they had never seen him before. However, Arlington <a href=#>police officers</a> confirmed that evidence at their crime scene was similar to evidence collected at the Plano shooting scene.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9949585ea163efd1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Adam Perkins' cause of death explained: What really happened</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Evidence collected from Franklin's phone records indicates that when the Plano shootings were taking place, he was at the location where two men were shot dead in a car in Arlington. As a result, Arlington <a href=#>police officers</a> have held back from pressing charges in connection to the Plano attacks.</p><p class=align-left>As the investigations are ongoing and no release date is in sight, his confinement is a constant reminder of the gravity of the charges against him. So, what charges is Franklin Barnes facing? They include:</p><ul><li>Murder</li><li>Attempted murder</li><li>Aggravated assault from the Plano shooting</li></ul><h2>Franklin Barnes' side of the story</h2><p class=align-left>In the middle of all the accusations and evidence presented, Franklin maintains his innocence. His version of the story brings out a different picture, hinting at a more complex and disturbing story. In his narration, Franklin stated that he and his girlfriend were driving from Arlington.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5cf3892768675fe8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is Spencer leaving General Hospital?

However, he stated that on their way, the two made a brief stop to procure a drug at around 7:00 am. He added that the two smoked in the car on their way to Plano.</p><p class=align-left>Later, he purchased more from his friend Quintarius Young. After buying the psychoactive drug, he spent some time with his girlfriend before going back to his McKinney home. He fell asleep and didn't wake up until police officers showed up at his home Thursday morning.</p><p class=align-left>At around 9:30 am, Plano police responded to a shooting spree that wounded three people and killed Young. Even though he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">admitted being at the scene</a> of both crimes, he denies being the man behind the trigger. He stated:</p>Man, I can't even; I really done cried my tears, you dig? I already cried my tears, and that stuff hurt. I didn't shoot nobody, definitely. And I don't recall shooting nobody; I don't have a gun.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6f279166a54c458c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What Jeffrey Dahmer's brain scan revealed about the serial killer</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/995af9121acf9cf8.jpg><h2>Franklin Barnes now</h2><p class=align-left>As the legal proceedings unfold and the investigations widen, the public's question remains: where is Franklin Barnes now?
