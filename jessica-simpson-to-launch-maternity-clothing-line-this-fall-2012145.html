The obvious next step for the Jessica Simpson Collection designer, whose empire is reportedly worth nearly $1 billion? An extension into maternity wear!</p><p>"I'm so excited to partner with Destination Maternity to design a collection of fashionable styles that make you look and feel great!" Simpson said in a statement released Monday. "You want to wear clothes that are flattering to your baby bump; you want to show your bump off."</p><p>Set to launch this fall, Jessica Simpson Maternity will be sold across the nation at Motherhood Maternity, Destination Maternity and Macy's. The pieces, which will include vintage-print tops, form-fitting jersey knit dresses and chunky realized sweaters, will start at $36.</p><p>Noticeably absent from the line: sky-high heels like the ones that Simpson swore she would give birth in when she went into labor.</p><p>"I'm probably going to deliver my baby in these [4-inch YSL heels]," the 31-year-old, who gave birth to little Maxwell, her first daughter with fiance <strong>Eric Johnson</strong>, on May 1, joked to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in November.</p><p>Sadly in the star's third trimester, the Fashion Star mentor found herself no longer teetering along in her designer footwear collection.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I can't wear heels anymore," the star lamented while shopping in a Santa Monica Fred Segal back in March. "I tried but it was too hard. Wearing heels is like a religion to me, so it's tough!"</p><p>"I can't wait for the day I can walk in heels again!" she tweeted two weeks before she gave birth. "My feet feel homesick!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajnaOotqStjKygpqijpLtuwM5mo5qtnpi1brnArZyrppmpxm6vy6iroaGenHqttc2eZK2gmah6p63LpWRraGFnfnWBjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
