Walking, talking dancing, souls cycle hiking in my near future,” the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar</a>-winner captioned a picture of herself in a hospital bed. <strong>Take a look at the photo below!</strong></p><p>And even though she had just gotten through with her surgery, the&nbsp;Paper Moon star was already on her feet, as she posted a video of herself going through the hospital. “Day of surgery I chose to walk three times down that massive hallway. Had the ALIF Anterior lumbar interbody fusion,” Tatum captioned the clip. She continued, “Congrats to #drneelanand master all things spine. And thank you Laura Balesty for being so helpful to me and @amandaarcherisme and @james_maa.”</p><p>She added, “To you my darling Sean I don’t know what I’d do without you your sage-like wisdom and belief in me through all my f–k ups with which there were many. Without you I would not have made it for sure!!! Thank you my darling son!!! There are no words to describe my love for you honey. I love you.” <strong>Check it out below!</strong></p><p>Tatum isn’t the only member of her family that has found themselves in the hospital lately — most recently, her father, <strong>Ryan O’Neal</strong>, was at a doctor’s office <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">getting a checkup</a>. “With my legendary dad!” Tatum captioned a photo on Instagram showing her father sitting in a medical checkup with a tube attached to his nose.
