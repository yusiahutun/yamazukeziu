She was in distress and needed quick help.</p><p class=align-left>The police arrived at the scene after seven minutes but left having not made contact with anyone. They received a second call two hours later, and this time, they found Cherletta Baber-Bey, 47, and <a href=#>Keyona Griffin</a>, 25, dead in their home on Sheldon Avenue.</p><h2>Derrell Brown and Cherletta Baber-Bey</h2><p class=align-left>Cherletta’s closest <a href=#>family</a> members described her as nurturing, trusting, and sweet but anti-social. "Jay" (Derrell Brown) was her first real boyfriend, and the couple kept to themselves, spending most of their time indoors in the bedroom.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9da76d5da1fa9c8c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dad of 2 Rongai Kids Allegedly Stabbed by Mum Inconsolable During Emotional Burial</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Derrell Brown and Cherletta Baber-Bey met at a downtown Grand Rapids public library. Cherletta routinely visited the library with her mother, but one day when alone, she met Derrell. They fell in love, and he moved into her home.</p><p class=align-left>Cherletta shared no information about Brown with her <a href=#>family members</a>, and most didn't care because he seemed calm and harmless.</p><p class=align-left>The only things that Cherletta's family members knew about "Jay" were that he didn't have a job or phone and wasn't using Facebook. In addition, they knew that Jay had served for failing to pay child support.</p><h2>Derrell Brown and Keyona Griffin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9da76d5da1fa9c8c.jpg><p class=align-left>At the time of their murder Cherletta, 47, lived in Grand Rapids, Michigan, with Derrell, while her lovely niece, Keyona Griffin, 25, visited them occasionally. Keyona had an incredible bond with her aunt and would visit her whenever she had time.</p><p class=align-left>However, Keyona, who had just turned 25 some days before the murder, wasn't fond of her aunt's boyfriend. She found him odd and weird. On 13th March 2019, she made <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the 911 call</a> but could barely talk. Keyona informed the police that "he" had killed her aunt, and she was next.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fa0b26a89852ccb4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kisumu: Form One Girl Murdered in Cold Blood while Heading Home from School, Form 3 Boy Arrested</span></p></a><h2>Has Derrell Demon Brown been found?</h2><p class=align-left>After the murder incident, the police took a lot of time to identify a suspect. Therefore Derrell Demon Brown had enough time to vanish. In the initial investigation, there were zero leads, making it challenging to identify a suspect.</p><p class=align-left>The authorities thoroughly examined the murder scene and its surroundings for a witness but were unsuccessful. They even interviewed some of Cherletta and Keyona's acquaintances, but none had an idea of anyone that could want to harm the two lovely women.</p><p class=align-left>The police decided to look into Cherletta and Keyona's interpersonal relationship only to discover that Cherletta had a boyfriend with a lengthy criminal record, including domestic violence and felony assault.</p><p class=align-left>At first, Derrell Brown was considered a person of interest in the case. But his continued absence raised more suspicion. Furthermore, the murder weapon was retrieved and traced to a woman who had reported it missing in 2017. Surprisingly this woman had dated Derrell Brown before.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3582382c21691313.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Embu Woman Who Went Missing 7 Days Ago Found Dead in Pit Latrine</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After the investigations, the police were confident that Derrell was an accomplice in the <a href=#>murder cases</a>. The prosecutor gave a warrant of arrest in Derrell Brown's name and charged him with two murder counts.</p><p class=align-left>So, was Derrell Brown captured? No, Brown has been on the run since 13th March 2019 and has completely disappeared off the grid.</p><h2>Derrell Demon Brown update</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/47e76fb9c2633adb.jpg><p class=align-left>There is no <a href=#>latest update</a> about Derrell Brown's whereabouts. US Marshalls think that his relatives might be helping him to evade capture. He has family in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Ohio.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>The question "Was Derrell Brown found?" is still asked four years after the murders of Cherletta Baber-Bay and Keyona Griffin. It’s unusual how Derrell managed to disappear completely. Usually, the police have something and are great at tracking suspects down, more so in murder cases. But Brown has been off the grid for years, making it more difficult to find him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d1a896e5156c09ac.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jay-Z's Mum Gloria Carter Weds Longtime Female Lover Roxanne in Lavish, Star-Studded Wedding</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke has shared an article on what happened to <a href=#>Keyona Griffin</a>.
