"All my life, the one absolute, reliable, healing, nurturing thing is in broader terms the natural world but more specifically the soil, "he said.&nbsp;</p><p id=ea2TqZsCnD5 data-wc=25>"I mean the earth, the land – if I can do that I'm at a trustworthy, honest, nurturing base level, from there I can grow."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c643619fc297-monty-don-sarah.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Monty on who he'd like to replace him on Gardeners' World&nbsp;</h2><p id=e9e6fSOYkkxz data-wc=56>While Adam Frost might be the fan-favourite when it comes to the new lead presenter, Monty has other ideas.
