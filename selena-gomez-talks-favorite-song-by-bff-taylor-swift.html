I really loved it all.”</p><p>Gomez met Swift, 34, in 2008 when they went out on a double date with then-boyfriends <strong>Nick</strong> and <strong>Joe Jonas</strong>. The duo have since supported each other at every turn, from hyping up each other’s projects to showing up in important moments. Forming a long-lasting bond is something Swift knew was inevitable from the moment she and Gomez crossed paths.</p><p>“There has always been this quality of sisterhood [with Selena], and I don’t say that in a basic way,” Swift told<i>&nbsp;</i>WSJ. Magazine in 2022. “I knew from when I met her I would always have her back. In my life, I have the ability to forgive people who have hurt me. But I don’t know if I can forgive someone who hurts her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/taylor-selena-177e2ac6-1ee6-49e1-ae89-625eedbf0598.jpg><p>Gomez most recently cheered Swift on during her Eras Tour stop in Los Angeles last year, taking little sister Gracie to a concert in March 2023. Gomez channeled Swift’s Folklore album for the event, while Gracie donned a Speak Now-inspired getup and was gifted the “Anti-Hero” artist’s hat <a href=#>during her “22” performance</a>.</p><p>“Thank you bestie for having me and my sissy transport into your mystical, euphoric and special world,” Gomez gushed via Instagram after the show. “Proud to know you! love you forever and always.”</p><p>Several months later, it was Swift’s turn to gush over Gomez when the Only Murders in the Building star released her first new song in two years, titled “Single Soon.”</p><p>“When [your] bestie is the bestest,” Swift wrote via her Instagram Story, praising the track “Will be dancing to this forever methinks.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While spinning tracks on Friday, Swift wasn’t the only pop princess that Gomez chose to highlight. In addition to <strong>Doja Cat</strong> and <strong>Frank Sinatra</strong>, the “Lose You to Love Me” singer also played <strong>Ariana Grande’s</strong> <a href=#>new song</a>, “Yes, And?”</p><p>“Ariana Grande. I cannot do anything fun without listening to Ariana,” Gomez shared. “I feel so empowered, and I think she’s incredible and I just have so much fun, so I’m the girl that’s playing Ariana all the time and I think people kind of notice that, but I love it. I think she’s amazing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZyau6J5xqiknrJdqa6tt9JmnZqun6e2tbGMrKann12Xxm6uxZ9krZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
