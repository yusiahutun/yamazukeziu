In one, she simply says: “My favourite new accessory”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e619f7d414e6-lily-collins-engagement-ring-accessory-z.jpg><p id=eRvALrT9AQ3w data-wc=9><strong>Lily's ring could be worth up to&nbsp;$100,000 dollars</strong></p><p id=e8OkTL9qF_aH data-wc=39>Speaking to <a class=hm-link href=#>Kelly Ripa</a> and Ryan Seacrest on Live with Kelly and Ryan, Lily revealed more about the precious ring: "It’s a rose-cut diamond.

Online:&nbsp;</p><p id=e_dX8KcmkSLB data-wc=62>“This looks like a very pretty rose-cut&nbsp;diamond and at a guess probably weighs between 2 or 3 carats. This style of diamond always appears larger because it is cut flatter than traditional, modern diamonds. It’s lovely ‘light pink’ colour and is exceptionally rare. While hard to place a value on it, it would certainly command <strong>a retail price upwards of £65,000</strong>”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/722ada8a2533-lily-collins-engagement-proposal-z.jpg><p id=ealnke9XAeya data-wc=10><strong>Lily's fiancé Charlie used self-timer to capture the beautiful moment</strong></p><p id=eWlUhn44RutE data-wc=37>According to The Natural Diamond Council: "The rose-cut diamond is more than 500 years old and was popular in the Georgian and Victorian eras [and now they] have made their triumphant comeback in the last five years".&nbsp;</p><p id=eJeFn4jab_K_ data-wc=47>Lily first announced the good news by sharing a photo on Instagram which revealed the moment partner Charlie McDowell got down on one knee.
