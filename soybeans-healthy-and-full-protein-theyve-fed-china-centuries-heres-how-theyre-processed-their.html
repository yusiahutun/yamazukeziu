Thicker, darker sauce becomes see yau (“bean oil”).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kecap manis, the characteristic salty-sweet Indonesian-style soy sauce, is thickened with cane or palm sugar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/09/2d3e663e-4041-4d5c-b49c-fbee9b0baa69_67adebd3.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Soybeans are also fermented to make dau see (“fermented beans”) and dau zeung; small quantities, mashed up and added to garlic, oil, shallots or chillies, make a tasty, inexpensive condiment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Well into the 20th century, Wan Chai and Yau Ma Tei in Hong Kong were known for soybean processing. Long-established small businesses across Hong Kong still produce sauces and pastes in limited quantities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yuen Long, in Hong Kong’s New Territories, was also known for soybean processing. Fermentation vats have a rank, immediately recognisable odour and for this reason, soybean factories were usually located in outlying areas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/09/53e3d443-7614-431c-93a1-f7fe4fce3339_0a0450d9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Massive stone grinding wheels that were used – once upon a time – to grind up soybeans as a preliminary part of various manufacturing processes can often be found abandoned in New Territories villages.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Too heavy to carry away, and with no other practical purpose to which they can be deployed, most just lie where they were last used – often at the corner of a threshing floor that typically extends in front of a row of old-style traditional village dwellings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Larger grinding stones were sometimes powered by buffalo, who walked in a circle harnessed to a pole that ground the stones together. Smaller versions had one or two strong adults perform the same task.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/09/d484f0b9-1485-447b-8607-e847694def32_609f2994.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Soybeans were a staple dietary item in Buddhist nunneries, and bean curd and soybean milk were often produced for sale to provide an additional income source in these remote rural retreats – mostly found in the New Territories.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Single laywomen who chose to live in these compounds were prime subjects for prurient gossip in traditional Chinese society and were generally assumed – rightly or otherwise – to be lesbians.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A particularly vulgar Cantonese euphemism – mor dau foo (“grind bean curd”) – is used to describe being a lesbian; dau foo por (“bean curd hag”) is a dismissive epithet for them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOrJ%2BoqqRiv6atw6xmmqqknrCtsY5saW5pZWyAcL%2FOspmemZ6oeqmxwKWrobFdlrulecWuo6VloKe8tbHIp2StoJWuw6Z5xZ6bZpuYnruiecKepa2top6ytHnHnqmeq12dvLh506GcsqqVYr2zu8KeqqydlGLBqbHIqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
