Savannah Chrisley & Nic Kerdiles</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Savannah Chrisley</strong></a> got engaged to her late boyfriend Nic Kerdiles back in 2019. Nic popped the question at Savannah's home in front of a group of family and friends. Looking back, Savannah says she definitely wasn't expecting a proposal and was actually annoyed at the time because cameras were rolling on her family's reality show.</p><p>"[On the night of the engagement], Nic's family was in town and my whole family was there and we were filming and I was furious. I was like, 'The fact we're filming on Christmas Eve is absolutely insane. I have people here,'" Savannah told <a href=#><strong>People</strong></a>.</p><p>She continued, "And then my mom said she forgot something at the store. So, I got in the car and went to the store with her. When we came back and we walked in the door, no one was there. Our best friend's kid, Dylan, goes, 'Hey, I think they're looking for you outside.' I walk outside and it's all lit up! And Nic's family is standing on one side, my family and friends are standing on the other, and then I just start freaking out because I‚Äôm like, 'This isn't really about to happen.' ‚Ä¶And it was just so cute and everyone was crying. It was just such a cool moment. And the fact that both of our families were there made it even better."</p><p>Unfortunately, the pair called it quits in 2020, with Nic <a href=#><strong>passing away in a motorcycle accident</strong></a> a few years later.</p><p><strong>9. Safaree & Erica Mena</strong></p><p>Back in 2018, <a href=#><strong>Safaree Samuels</strong></a> proposed to girlfriend Erica Mena on Christmas Eve at her home in Atlanta. The pair were surrounded by friends and family -- as well as 200 candles and 20,000 rose petals. To top it all off, the engagement ring was <a href=#><strong>reportedly</strong></a> worth over $175,000. The pair went on to tie the knot but ultimately separated in 2022.</p><p><strong>10. Kacey Musgraves & Ruston Kelly</strong></p><p>In 2016, <a href=#><strong>Kacey Musgraves</strong></a> got engaged to her musician boyfriend Ruston Kelly. Ruston popped the question in Kacey's childhood bedroom, which her family had decorated "in the most nostalgic and perfect Christmas decorations."</p><p>"I didn't say yes‚Ä¶ I said HELL YESSSS!! Last night the best man I've ever met got down on one knee in my little pink childhood home," Kacey wrote in <a href=#><strong>a now-deleted post</strong></a>. "In the same room I played with my ponies and barbies and asked me the easiest question I've ever been asked. I finally know what everyone means when they say, 'You just know.'"</p><p>Kacey and Ruston got married in 2017 but divorced three years later.</p><a id=gallery-link-77ca4eae-707f-4597-b0e9-9c04b28a0dad class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:77ca4eae-707f-4597-b0e9-9c04b28a0dad data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:dd8bc1cf-8634-41a7-b4a2-9373475acb9d data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7f/4by3/2023/12/21/7f9d210697004b30810c9068ca8d729e_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtma2xfmLKtscGroK2xXZi8trzLnqpmnZ6crqixw2aaoaqZqMGurdJmnK%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
