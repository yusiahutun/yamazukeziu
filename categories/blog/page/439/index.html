The now 29-year-old reality star had been feeling uneasy about seeing the Loyal Babe for the first time since their long-standing feud. The pair originally clashed horns following their stint on series four after Georgia claimed Megan had "slagged her off".
With the pair both being recruited for Love Island Games in Fiji last year, there was no escaping the fact they would have to face one another after almost five years. <a href=../../../../megan-barton-hanson-nervous-reunite-32073942.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../buffy-the-vampire-slayer-the-gift-season-5-finale-series-legacy-html.html>The Buffy Episode That Changed Everything</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

In the world of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, there is a Before and there is an After. I am talking, of course, about “The Gift” — the pivotal, superb hour of television that closed out season five, in which Buffy sacrifices herself for the greater good, plummeting off a tower into the hellish portal beneath. When the episode was written by now-maligned creator Joss Whedon and aired in May 2001, it was intended as the series finale; after five years on the WB, the acclaimed but low-rated show was left in limbo before eventually moving to UPN for its final two years. <a href=../../../../buffy-the-vampire-slayer-the-gift-season-5-finale-series-legacy-html.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../best-dry-hand-gloves.html>Best Dry Hand Gloves for Restoring Moisture to Your Skin</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

I’m talking scaly patches, ashiness that just doesn’t seem to budge and callus sprouts just above my palms. Though this doesn’t happen all the time, a combo of eczema and over-zealous hand-washing can occasionally lead to a tireless search for the best dry hand gloves.
I love a good hand sheet mask moment, but when worse comes to worst, I need an overnight option that won’t leave CeraVe ointment all over the bedsheets, especially if my nails could use some TLC, too. <a href=../../../../best-dry-hand-gloves.html>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../../../categories/blog/page/438/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
