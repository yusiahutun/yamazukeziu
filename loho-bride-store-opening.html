While there has been a drastic increase in up-and-coming, fresh, new dress labels, the amount of shops with the chutzpah to carry them have waned.

Owner Christy Baird founded LOHO (an acronym for League of Her Own) with the intention of giving women like herself a place to shop. After a successful run in a small industrial loft in San Francisco, Baird is bringing her knowledge of the market to her L.A. fan base. We got a chance to speak to Christy exclusively and snag a sneak peek at her new Melrose Avenue&nbsp;HQ, which opens it's doors this week.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Sleeve, Textile, White, Style, Fashion, Street fashion, Beige, Ivory, Fashion design, Foot, " title="Sleeve, Textile, White, Style, Fashion, Street fashion, Beige, Ivory, Fashion design, Foot, " width=1091 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/12/1458936179-hbz-joncu-embed-01.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jon Cu</span><p>Christy Baird, Founder and Owner of LOHO Bride</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Harper's Bazaar</strong>:&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Tell us about LOHO – who is the LOHO Bride</strong>?&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Christy Baird</strong>:&nbsp;When I close my eyes and think about who our bride is, I have visions of&nbsp;her instead of coming up with&nbsp;adjectives to describer her–she's the type of woman who transcends labels and convention. That's how I came to naming the brand "League Of Her Own;" after writing down all of these ways to describe her, I decided that the ethos of the brand was to have her define herself. She decides what kind of bride she is, and there is just an organic confidence behind how she feels&nbsp;during an incredibly meaningful day. She doesn't have to ask herself if she can pull something off, she just does.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Our brides are looking for quality-made, hard to find designers. They come to us for a tightly curated [edit]&nbsp;that they can rely on without having to weed&nbsp;through racks and racks of gowns that aren't them, while receiving a personalized experience. When I'm buying, I gravitate towards gowns that have personality; gowns that we all haven't seen over and over again. Our selection ranges from edgier, minimalist&nbsp;styles to airy, ethereal silhouettes.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB</strong>:&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>What's your bridal background?

We sourced vintage gowns from all over the world;&nbsp;figuring out how to modernize the gown for today's bride was such a learning process. It was my first peek into what brides yearned for. I kept my eyes on opening a store, so we parted ways&nbsp;after the business was starting to take off. She has continued building it into the cult-bohemian bridal line Daughters of Simone. We just recently had a little moment to reflect on how cool it is that our initial curiosity was able to flourish into full time&nbsp;careers for both of us. It's truly a beautiful thing to see it come full circle,&nbsp;even more surreal to see her get married as a Daughters of Simone bride last year! Goes to show that just starting something can evolve beyond your wildest dreams.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Interior design, Textile, Room, Interior design, Linens, Clothes hanger, Beige, Window treatment, Tablecloth, Bouquet, " title="Interior design, Textile, Room, Interior design, Linens, Clothes hanger, Beige, Window treatment, Tablecloth, Bouquet, " width=2800 height=2108 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/12/1458936115-hbz-joncu-embed-10.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jon Cu</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB</strong>:&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>What inspired you to open up&nbsp;LOHO in the first place?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>CB</strong>:&nbsp;One year I had 9 weddings to attend and all along, I couldn't help but wonder where someone like me would go to find her wedding dress. After a lot of intensive research, I found there was a very clear gap in the market. Fast forward to a few years ago, I still didn't see multi-label stores committing to the aesthetic I was going for, yet there were a lot more designers out there who were breaking the mold. &nbsp;I finally took the plunge. Out of all life's bad timing, the timing of LOHO felt pretty perfect. We had brides booked out for two months before opening our San Francisco location after throwing a successful pop-up six months earlier. I was so worried that we were too niche, but I've found comfort in meeting all of our brides who have reconfirmed that we've been their only answer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB</strong>:&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>What makes a brand LOHO material?

I am looking for&nbsp;brands whose&nbsp;collections are so uniquely them that they don't remind you of that one line two years ago; brands who&nbsp;aren't afraid to make a bold statement in an industry that leans towards being sweet and ultra-feminine. Typically&nbsp;when I find a brand that I'm interested in, I can't get them out of my mind and I instantly know what kind of bride they would attract; I start envisioning how she might style the gown and&nbsp;what venue would compliment it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB</strong>:<strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>After San Francisco, why LA?

They expressed being in desperate need for a store like us, so just as we did with SF, we tested the demographic out with a pop-up in LA, it was wildly successful, and it gave us the sign we were looking for. So far, SF and LA brides are very different; generally speaking, they're on the pulse with fashion in different ways and they value different things, which is what makes having two stores so fascinating. Surprisingly enough, SF girls need a little more nudging to try some wild card gowns on, but they end up going for them. LA girls have been pretty specific about what they like, they know their bodies and they aren't there to dilly dally, which is also wonderful because they're quicker to make a decision with that confidence.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Floor, Room, Wood, Interior design, Property, Flooring, Wall, Furniture, White, Home, " title="Floor, Room, Wood, Interior design, Property, Flooring, Wall, Furniture, White, Home, " width=2800 height=2108 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/12/1458937214-hbz-joncu-embed-04.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jon Cu</span></p><img alt="Textile, White, Clothes hanger, Ivory, Fashion design, Collection, Lace, " title="Textile, White, Clothes hanger, Ivory, Fashion design, Collection, Lace, " width=1125 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/12/1458937444-hbz-joncu-embed-13.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jon Cu</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB</strong>: <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Can you describe an ideal appointment at LOHO LA?

We do serious prep work before they even walk through our door by having them fill out a detailed questionnaire, which helps us make thoughtful suggestions as we're styling them. There is a lot of "feeling out her vibe" within the first few minutes. I always tell our bridal stylists that each girl has different needs and what we do for one bride, we might not do for another. The idea is to make dress shopping a fun, light-hearted part of wedding planning. &nbsp;As long as they leave feeling good and relaxed, we've done our job. That will likely involve champagne flowing and a customized playlist, but only if that's their preference of course!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB</strong>: <strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>You've been designing the L.A. store for months with designer duo (and married couple!)&nbsp;<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://stewart-schafer.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Stewart-Schafer class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Stewart-Schafer</a>.

Many girls&nbsp;say in our San Francisco showroom that it feels as if they're playing dress up in a friend's apartment, so it was important to keep that unpretentious, safe environment with our LA location. Clean lines, neutral tones, and a mix of edgy, yet feminine details&nbsp;set the tone for the project.&nbsp;You enter through a beautiful outdoor courtyard with lounges and&nbsp;lush Californian greenery. I had always said if I found a space with outdoor area, that would be the ultimate. Once you enter the space, you instantly see our striking racks with the juxtaposition of our soft, dreamy gowns hanging, in what we started calling&nbsp;&nbsp;"the gallery." Then on each side of the gallery, there is a lounge with a fitting room, which is private to the bride and her support crew. Every detail in the store was very thought out and intentional, catering to what we thought would make our clients feel&nbsp;amazing.</p><img alt="Room, Interior design, Wall, Table, Interior design, Shelving, Shelf, Living room, Throw pillow, Still life photography, " title="Room, Interior design, Wall, Table, Interior design, Shelving, Shelf, Living room, Throw pillow, Still life photography, " width=2635 height=3500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/12/1458937316-joncu03192016029527-r1-e009.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jon Cu</span></p><img alt="Flowerpot, Room, Interior design, Flooring, Feather, Natural material, Grey, Fur, Houseplant, Black-and-white, " title="Flowerpot, Room, Interior design, Flooring, Feather, Natural material, Grey, Fur, Houseplant, Black-and-white, " width=2108 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/12/1458937935-hbz-joncu-embed-05.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jon Cu</span></p><img alt="Flowerpot, Branch, Interior design, Serveware, Vase, Artifact, Still life photography, Pottery, Twig, Ceramic, " title="Flowerpot, Branch, Interior design, Serveware, Vase, Artifact, Still life photography, Pottery, Twig, Ceramic, " width=2108 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/12/1458938163-hbz-joncu-embed-09.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jon Cu</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB</strong>:&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>What&nbsp;do&nbsp;your&nbsp;brides&nbsp;tell&nbsp;you&nbsp;they've&nbsp;found&nbsp;with&nbsp;you&nbsp;that&nbsp;they&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;found elsewhere?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>CB</strong></strong>:&nbsp;Many of our brides tell us that we're by far the best&nbsp;experience they've had.&nbsp;We treat them as our own. Instead of being pushy, we're supportive and informative. Brides have enough stress to deal with; we strive to take away even one layer of that. Making them feel good is just as important as providing them&nbsp;with stunning gowns to try on. &nbsp;We're also providing a solution for the fashion conscious bride who doesn't&nbsp;want &nbsp;to spend $10,000&nbsp;on her&nbsp;gown, but who really appreciates high-quality and high-design garments. We're sitting in the middle, with our gowns ranging from $2,500-8,000. Being that we specialize in hard-to-find designers, the bride who can't stand seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;her gown worn by hundreds of women a year can sleep at night knowing that there are limited quantities sold. For a handful of the designers, we are their only U.S. retailer.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Footwear, Product, Shoe, White, Tan, Beige, Brand, Collection, Walking shoe, Fashion design, " title="Footwear, Product, Shoe, White, Tan, Beige, Brand, Collection, Walking shoe, Fashion design, " width=2800 height=2108 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/12/1458938000-hbz-joncu-embed-07.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jon Cu</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>HB</strong>:&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>What bridal&nbsp;designers are you most excited about right now?&nbsp;</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>CB</strong>:&nbsp;I'm obviously excited about all of my designers! Every market I go to, they&nbsp;inspire me and get me thinking about the future of our business, what's next for us, how we're going to move forward and keep creating.&nbsp;If I had to highlight one designer that I'm excited to watch and see present at this year's market though, it would be <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://odylynetheceremony.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Odylyne: The Ceremony" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Odylyne: The Ceremony</a> because&nbsp;I've been fortunate enough to see the designer Stephanie birth her bridal collection from the start. LOHO San Francisco was the first to trunk show for her&nbsp;collection last year and from the second I unpacked the gowns, I knew she had a powerful vision–unlike&nbsp;anything I'd ever seen before. I'm instantly captivated by the imagery she creates,&nbsp;and when you meet her brides&nbsp;the essence of her brand radiates around them. It's the moments like this that get me excited; to support a designer bringing something original to&nbsp;market, especially a historically traditional one, is nothing short of exhilarating. I've had that moment with all of our designers, but she's definitely been that recent breath of fresh air.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Room, Interior design, Textile, Bouquet, Table, Interior design, Centrepiece, Clothes hanger, Petal, Artifact, " title="Room, Interior design, Textile, Bouquet, Table, Interior design, Centrepiece, Clothes hanger, Petal, Artifact, " width=2800 height=2108 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/12/1458938535-hbz-joncu-embed-02.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jon Cu</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="p2 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">LOHO Bride Los Angeles,&nbsp;8282 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90049; For appointments email HELLOLA@LOHOBRIDE.COM.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/916d9b02-8867-4c91-934d-6abbc239c04d_1547134719.png alt="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" title="Headshot of Carrie Goldberg" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Carrie Goldberg is HarpersBAZAAR.com’s Weddings & Travel Director.
