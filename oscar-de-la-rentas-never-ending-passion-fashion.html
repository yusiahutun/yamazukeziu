For 20 years, he dressed Clinton at monumental moments of her life, from her husband's presidential inauguration to Clinton's first American cover.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"And despite his best efforts, year in and year out, he's never given up," Clinton said at the gala event in April where de La Renta received Carnegie Hall's seventh Medal of Excellence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"To dress a first lady is an enormous privilege," de la Renta said in an interview with STYLE this year. "When you design clothes, you often think of a woman in general, but in this special case, that woman is larger than life. She will mean many different things to different people. She is an icon."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">De la Renta's stellar clientele included not only first ladies but also Hollywood stars, socialites and more who favour his dresses at parties, on the red carpet and even down the aisle - Jenna Bush, daughter of former US president George W. Bush, wore an Oscar de la Renta wedding gown, as did Kate Bosworth, star of .</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The design wunderkind also won numerous awards, including the Council of Fashion Designers of America's (CFDA) Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989 before twice taking home the CFDA's Womenswear Designer of the Year Award, in 2000 and 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2014/09/25/fe5f68fa4f0ace744c6c4c792941d440.jpg>Speaking about all the prizes he has garnered, the modest designer shrugged and said: "I always say that I have the memory of a mosquito. I don't ever look back, but always look forward. My best work lies ahead of me."<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Dominican Republic-born de la Renta began his starry career in Madrid when he decided to learn painting at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. During his training in Madrid, de la Renta landed an apprenticeship at the atelier of Spanish couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga - who de la Renta still cited as one of his biggest influences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I still work today in the manner that I saw Balenciaga work," he once said. "A dress only becomes yours when you start manipulating it, which is what I do."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After his stint with Balenciaga, de la Renta moved on to a slew of prominent French couturiers, such as Christian Dior and Lanvin, before relocating to New York. While the European couture houses might have helped him hone his craft, it was Manhattan's high society that contributed to the realisation of de la Renta's American dream. Recommended by Elizabeth Arden - one of the wealthiest women in the world in the 1960s and definitely a well-connected woman in New York back then - de la Renta built his stellar clientele, which laid the foundation for his fashion empire.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For de la Renta, his muses had always been strong-minded women.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"At the heart of each collection is the idea of a modern woman. She is completely in control of her life and her destiny. This is a woman with an extraordinarily busy life and a woman who knows exactly what she wants," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2014/09/25/942e30f607dd789043aa867d9e5db5c9.jpg>Modern women fascinated the designer even more than when he first started.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The 21st-century woman is unbelievable," he said. "We have to celebrate all that women have achieved in such a short period of time. This is the most exciting time to be dressing a woman. Never before has a woman been so in control of her destiny."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such passion for the belle du jour had also become the source of his inspiration. "My inspiration is always the anonymous woman on the street, the woman with a busy, full life. I think about her needs and what she will want to wear. My role as a designer has always been to design clothes that address a woman's life and make her feel beautiful - that is what continues to inspire me creatively," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The design process, de la Renta said, had never been a difficult process. "I love designing. Every piece is special. I find so much joy in the work that I do."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was releasing four ready-to-wear collections a year, plus two annual bridal collections and accessories lines. Yet you would still find him stealing the spotlight at fundraisers, parties and events with his impeccable elegance, intelligence and occasionally jazzy vocals - the designer was known among his close circle of friends as a good singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2014/09/25/45c688a2820626283de10f91c5af0251.jpg>Addressing his Dominican roots, the world-famous designer dedicated himself to helping children in his hometown. His charity, Casa del Niño, cares for 1,500 children on a daily basis and also provides them with an education. "Every child deserves a proper education and the support of a family - whether it's the family that they are born into or the one that finds them," he said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, fashion was the thing that made de la Renta tick."I could put on the most spectacular show, but it doesn't mean anything until a woman decides to wear my clothes. I make clothes that address the needs of my customers, their many different lifestyles, as well as cultural sensibilities," he said. "Fashion, to me, is about making a woman look her best."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">MILESTONES</strong></p><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1957</strong><br>Works as an apprentice at Cristobal Balenciaga’s Spanish couture shop<br><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-5 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1963</strong><br>Relocates to Manhattan and makes his debut at Elizabeth Arden<br><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-10 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1982</strong><br>Establishes charity Casa del Niño for underprivileged children in the Dominican Republic<br><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/2014/10/02/20141003_style_muse1.jpg><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-16 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1992</strong><br>Heads French fashion house Balmain’s couture and ready-to-wear collections<br><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-21 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1997</strong><br>Dresses Hillary Clinton for the presidential inauguration of her husband<br><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-26 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2001</strong><br>Launches accessories line<br><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-31 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2004</strong><br>Opens boutique on Madison Avenue, New York<br><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-36 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2007</strong><br>Shares CFDA Womenswear Designer of the Year Award with Proenza Schouler<br><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-41 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2013</strong><br>“Oscar de la Renta: An American Icon” retrospective exhibition opens at William J.
