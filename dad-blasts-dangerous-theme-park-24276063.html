He went on the rollercoaster with two of his children and noticed the seats were "covered in bird poo", he claims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24268411.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/2_rollercoaster.jpg><p>Dean, a first aid community advocate, said: "My family and I were in a cart on the ground at the point when the ride broke down. There was a family screaming at the top of the ride.</p><p>"We were trying to work out what was going on. When that family had got to the top, the whole thing had shut down.</p><p>"The operator was rushing around, and I asked him what was going on. He said the sensors are faulty and sometimes they switch off.</p><p>"The family at the top were 25 to 30ft in the air. It was a man and three young girls. They were screaming for a little bit, they panicked and didn't know what was going on."</p><p>"The operator was telling people to keep shuffling in their cart to get it moving again. He was bashing on buttons. It took at least 15 minutes for the ride to get going again.</p><p>"This was our first ride. We went in, and you don't really expect that. That was a big red flag but we'd paid for four hours so we thought we'd press on.”</p><p>He says that a dodgems ride was started up while his seven-year-old daughter was still getting into the car – "There had been no safety checks. The man didn't check where the children were,” he said.</p><p>He added that he spoke to a member of staff, who didn’t appear to understand him.</p><p>"I was so angry," Dean said. "It was by mere luck my daughter didn't get hit. She's only seven."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>Dean says he posted a complaint about his experience on the Funderworld Facebook page, but he claims this was deleted. He feels his voice has been "silenced".</p><p>A Funderworld spokeswoman said: "It is not possible to comment on alleged incidents. There are policies, processes and procedures which enable people to resolve their issue or have it duly processed by the appropriate authorities and agencies.</p><p>"The leisure and entertainment industry is tightly controlled to ensure safety standards are maintained to a high level. They also protect either party from unsubstantiated claims or cover ups."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwuMCtnKysXaOyuL%2BOnZidZZKhrrTA0mabmqaXmr%2BwwdJmq6GdnZp6sa3RpGRrbGJsg3GCkg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
