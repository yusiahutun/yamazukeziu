We are targeting to increase the number to 200 by the end of next year as we look to produce more shoe designs in the market,” he said.<p class=align-left>The move, Seibel said, will help to relieve the company from high import taxes when demand exceeds its local production capacity.</p><p class=align-left>The company trains local staff- without knowledge of shoe making- from scratch, which it said has proven as a better system to meet high international quality, comfort and safety standards.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/491ae9e62cfe9727.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>From tanks to subsidies: the main topics at Davos</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The company will leverage franchise models to expand its presence in Nairobi with plans to open more outlets in <a href=# rel=noopener>Mombasa</a>, other coastal towns near its factory and across Kenya.</p>“We have done the market study and are looking at opening 12 to 14 outlets across the country including Kisumu, Nanyuki, Nakuru, Kericho and other towns coming up,” said Josef Seibel Franchisee, Joe Ndungu“Yes we can produce shoes here and export them to Germany,” Ndungu added.<p class=align-left>German Ambassador to Kenya, Sebastian Groth termed the investment another big step for Germany and Kenya and adds to the total 120 German companies in the country.</p>“Germany will in the future look more and more interested towards Africa and Kenya especially in regards to investment and economic relations.
