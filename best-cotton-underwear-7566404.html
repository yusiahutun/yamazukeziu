But that’s actually far from the truth: These days, cotton underwear exists in all shapes and sizes — from teeny-tiny thongs to full-coverage boxers — so you can get the comfort of the fabric without having to forgo your favorite styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That’s good news because cotton has a bunch of properties that make it the perfect fabric for underwear. “Because cotton is a natural fiber, it lets the skin breathe, and has absorbent and wicking properties,” says Dora Lau, founder of lingerie solutions company Dora L. International. “It reduces odors and the risk of skin rashes and discomfort. Cotton is also biodegradable and durable.” If that’s enough to convince you, keep reading for a look at the very best cotton underwear out there right now.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-skims-cotton-logo-high-leg-bikini></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>SKIMS Cotton Logo High Leg Bikini</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="SKIMS Cotton Logo High Leg Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-qkWH0cSLdINUWATGIL_kEyNrVE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-cotton-logo-high-leg-bikini-558256623ddc4bebbc41e4af91ec08e3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SKIMS</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s incredibly comfortable and long-lasting, too.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The tag is scratchy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We have to hand it to co-founder Kim Kardashian — SKIMS has only existed for a handful of years, but it’s already a definite go-to for shapewear, loungewear, and underwear alike. Stylist and creative director Lauren Coppen is a huge fan of their cotton panties in particular, which she says offer a perfect fit and are made from long-lasting fabric. And as with all SKIMS products, this one comes in sizes up to 4X, which is more inclusive than a majority of brands out there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This bikini is similar to a classic Calvin Klein pair but with a cheekier style for those who prefer less coverage. It’s incredibly comfortable thanks to soft cotton and stretchy spandex, but there’s just one snag: The tag is scratchy, even if you try to cut it off as closely as possible. If the brand were to make a tagless version, this would be the absolute perfect panty, but as it stands, it’s pretty damn close.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-4X | <strong>Colors</strong>: 10 |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Mixed with spandex |<strong> Style: </strong>Bikini |<strong> Organic: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-fruit-of-the-loom-womens-boyshort-panty></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fruit of the Loom Women's Boyshort Panty</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Fruit of the Loom Women's Boyshort Panty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/z9yu-NQoOocjSn0VM3i0QiR7E3k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fruit-of-the-loom-womens-6-pack-d5882954ebeb48079d0522bbf39b7133.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re comfy enough for daily wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The elastic band loses its stretch easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a budget-friendly brand, Fruit of the Loom has super cute branding that makes it a lot more fun than other affordable brands — and which is part of why Marian Kwei, a celebrity stylist and creative consultant, thinks these boy shorts are a great buy. Coming in at under $2 a pair, these underwear don’t compromise on quality. They’re made from extra soft cotton and designed not to pinch or tug in unfortunate ways, making them ideal for daily wear. Reviewers love how they fit, and they’re also moisture-wicking and tag-free to avoid any uncomfortable itching. Make sure to wash them on a low setting, though, because the elastic band is quite delicate and will lose its stretch quickly otherwise.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 2 |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Yes |<strong> Style: </strong>Briefs |<strong> Organic: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-coucou-the-high-rise-white-pointelle></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coucou The High Rise White Pointelle</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Coucou The High Rise White Pointelle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rat00SpY-LLGqDF_FHW9KeLJTzY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/coucou-the-high-rise-white-pointelle-9e7fddd8b804400da2e5864c25f7c8da.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Coucou</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re retro but never frumpy.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You have to wash them on a gentle cycle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re obsessed with the retro vibes of this pointelle panty, which is designed with a slight high-rise fit to avoid looking frumpy. Coppen says these “have the best, most flattering shape” and are well worth the investment. They’re made from 100 percent organic cotton, with a classic striped, patterned pointelle main, French lace detailing, and an adorably tiny ribbon bow at the top.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, these are as delicate as they look and will need washing on a gentle cycle and laying flat to dry — no tumble-dryer, please! While this extra care means they’re not necessarily the best pick for every day, they are comfortable enough to take you through a busy day’s schedule. Pair them with a matching cami for the complete effect. BTW, did we mention these are fully compostable at the end of their life cycle?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-XXL | <strong>Colors</strong>: White, black |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Yes |<strong> Style: </strong>Briefs |<strong> Organic: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-skims-cotton-rib-boxer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Cotton Rib Boxer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cotton Rib Boxer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eciOBR-UtkuNv_wLra47OcDRLOw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/skims-cotton-rib-boxer-93c17d6d550b47bb9ef9471ee5a95556.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The ultimate boyfriend boxer, no boyfriend required.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You may need to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We really do <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>have a soft spot for SKIMS at InStyle</a>, but we promise we’re not biased: Reviewers and industry insiders are equally obsessed. “If you are just casually chilling at home, this is my go-to,” says model and fashion influencer Nastya Swan of these boxers. “I used to always steal my boyfriend's boxers before I found these female boxers — literally the best lounge panties-slash-shorts. I could live in them and suggest you do also!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like our best overall pair, available in lovely neutral tones in sizes XXS to 4X, this SKIMS underwear is made from breathable cotton with a little spandex thrown in for extra comfort and features a contrasting waistband for extra cuteness. Like Swan, reviewers can’t get over how comfy these are, and they love how they look, too: They hug your natural shape beautifully and are perfect for lounging. Most people say these are true to size, but others recommend sizing up for a better fit around the thighs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-4X | <strong>Colors</strong>: 12 |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Mixed with spandex |<strong> Style: </strong>Boxer |<strong> Organic: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-nude-nubian-skin-cotton-thong></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Nude</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nubian Skin Cotton Thong</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nubian Skin Cotton Thong" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MxJL37gGgeKMcPMVxQFIkF6rF9g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nubian-skin-cotton-thong-141155c10491446ab6e041c9feb7a7dc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nubian</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Zero VPL guaranteed.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> More sizes would be great.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s incredibly frustrating when brands claim to make their products in a “nude” color, but it’s actually only suitable for pale skin tones. Nubian Skin has the answer: nude basics are made exclusively for darker skin tones. “Everyday underwear are more practical when they come in a matching skin tone shade: UK brand Nubian Skin offers a range of brown nude cotton underwear in several shapes,” says Wencillia Querbel of @cosmicgirlsneedbras. “For those who want nothing to do with visible panty lines, I recommend their cotton thongs which come in four shades of brown.” These feature discreet edges to help guarantee an invisible look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These thongs are super breathable as well as eco-friendly thanks to their Better Cotton Initiative cotton, while elastane ensures they stretch to fit your curves. They’re also super comfy and ideal for everyday wear. We’d just love to see more sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XXL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 4 |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Mixed with elastane |<strong> Style: </strong>Thong |<strong> Organic: </strong>No<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-thong-victorias-secret-logo-cotton-thong-panty></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Thong</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Victoria’s Secret Logo Cotton Thong Panty</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Victoria&amp;acirc;s Secret Logo Cotton Thong Panty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/A8ZMt0aOVb38TElzTkGS33Wwv1Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/victorias-secret-logo-cotton-thong-panty-5960535e8d4c4c1cba2302a125d6394d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Victoriaâs Secret&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’ll make you feel super cute.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The size range is lacking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These thong panties are one of Swan’s all-time favorites. “These are perfect for everyday life — super comfy and make your waist look so sophisticated and beautiful,” she says. “Every time I look in the mirror after a shower and I just wear these panties I feel myself a little more.” Feeling cute and/or sexy in underwear can be such a mood-booster, so these deserve a spot on this list for that aspect alone, but they also come with many more perks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They’re made from a cotton, modal, and elastane blend, which helps avoid VPL, and feature a fun stretchy waistband. If you’ve ever shopped from Victoria’s Secret, you’ll know that every style is constantly being re-edited in all kinds of different solid colors and prints — from cheetah to polka dots and everything in between. That’s the case with these, too, meaning there’s sure to be a style (or many) for everyone, plus you can often get a discount when you bundle them. It’s just a shame the size range is lacking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 30 |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Mixed with modal and elastane |<strong> Style: </strong>Thong |<strong> Organic: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bikini-calvin-klein-carousel-logo-cotton-bikini-3-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bikini</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calvin Klein Carousel Logo Cotton Bikinis</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Calvin Klein Carousel Logo Cotton 3-Pack Bikini" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jqXm2DsTTlSAm6WULLDNjs38Eu0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Calvin-Klein-Cotton-Stretch-Bikini-ca6e0119fd984dfc919e9d3ec48dde3e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Calvin Klein</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There are so many prints to choose from.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We’d love if Calvin Klein also made cheekies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to cotton panties, it doesn’t get more iconic than a pair of Calvin Kleins. Coppen has a bone to pick with the brand, but she still recommends these ones as a great quality basic. “They haven’t mastered the demi bottom; they either make full coverage or thong,” the expert says. “However they are good for sports and every day and last a very long time.” Basically, if you happen to prefer a full-coverage bikini, you’re in luck. The cotton is lovely and soft, and the logo waistband keeps everything in place without tugging or folding over.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like Victoria’s Secret, Calvin Klein sticks to a few basic styles, and re-edits them in a variety of simple colors and fun prints, so you can build a serious collection — starting with one of these three-packs. We love a basic black pair, but we’re equally enthralled by the red and white horizontal stripe print. Whatever your preferences, you’ll definitely find a pair (or three) that’s calling your name here.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL | <strong>Colors</strong>: Multi |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Mixed with elastane |<strong> Style: </strong>Bikini |<strong> Organic: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-natori-bliss-cotton-french-cut-briefs></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Natori Bliss Cotton French Cut Briefs</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Natori Bliss Cotton French Cut Briefs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JlhlrK8Wwy9DWObMMb69Ip6dt_k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/natori-womens-bliss-french-cut-panty-55019be069a945cf82be8a008193baca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The lace is cute and VPL-free.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They can sometimes ride up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How cute are these? We can just imagine building a collection of Natori’s French cut style in all the colors of the rainbow — from pastels to extra-bright brights. By the sounds of it, that’s exactly what lovers of this style do and with good reason. They’re made from high-quality Pima cotton and spandex for stretch, and feature sweet lace borders that don’t cut into the skin, meaning that they’re both comfortable and VPL-free. Unfortunately, some people find that these briefs ride up a little. Still, they have legions of fans that keep coming back for more.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XXL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 74 |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Mixed with spandex |<strong> Style: </strong>French Cut |<strong> Organic: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-unlined-intimissimi-seamless-supima-cotton-panties></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Unlined</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Intimissimi Seamless Panties</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Intimissimi Seamless Supima Cotton Panties" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wzV3pKbxB-wtvFP9FYJjidTkGzA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/intimissimi-seamless-supima-cotton-panties-7a0ac4f1932b4518ab0d7e369fae1ab7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Intimissimi</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re made from US-farmed Supima cotton.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The size range is tiny.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If this style came in a less exclusive size range, we’d have to give it a perfect score. It was recommended by two of the experts we spoke to because it’s just such a great panty. “Absolutely love Intimissimi Seamless Panties,” says Swan. “They are so simple and the quality of the Italian fabric is always noticeable. You almost don’t feel them on your body. This is perfect for wearing underneath a going-out dress or a bodycon dress.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">UK-based stylist Emma Lightbown agrees: If you want to switch to cotton underwear but are concerned about them showing through your clothes (and are looking for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best no-show panties</a>), these unlined panties have got you. “If you wish to avoid the dreaded VPL, try these from Intimissimi,” Lightbown says. “The raw cut cotton minimizes the chance of VPL, plus you get the benefits of breathable, seam-free, stretch fabric.” Honestly, it’s almost hard to believe these are made of cotton since they’re such an easy, smooth style. Believe the hype: They’re made from Supima cotton, which is farmed in the US for better traceability.

You can match these with Fleur du Mal’s lace-detail bra as well if you’re looking to go all out. Also, they’re made from organic cotton, meaning they’re extra planet-friendly. Once again, though, this is one more brand that doesn’t consider a wide range of body types with its sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-L | <strong>Colors</strong>: 2 |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Mixed with elastane |<strong> Style: </strong>Thong |<strong> Organic: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cheeky-hm-5-pack-brazilian-briefs></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cheeky</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H&M 5-Pack Brazilian Briefs</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="H&amp;amp;M 5-Pack Brazilian Briefs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pVhEJGRXA0ZgqVtlVPR2r9w8PpM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hm-5-pack-brazilian-briefs-90824adfb3234798a17c3e9a5bd750c5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>H&M</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re great value.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Only some colorways are made from organic cotton.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For something on the more affordable side, Swan is a big proponent of a good old H&M multi-pack. While we haven’t tried this exact style IRL, we can attest that the brand knows how to make underwear that holds up to scrutiny. These Brazilian briefs are halfway between a cheeky and a thong, perfect for those looking for just that little bit of back coverage from their cotton panties. They’re low-waisted but come up higher at the back, as well as delicately lace-trimmed and topped off with a little ribbon bow. They’re also really comfortable and soft, fit true to size, and won’t give you a wedgie. If you can, we’d recommend opting for one of the multi-packs made up of organic cotton underwear, since not all colorways use that more eco-friendly material.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-XXL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 4 |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Mixed with spandex |<strong> Style: </strong>Briefs |<strong> Organic: </strong>Style-dependent</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-briefs-gooseberry-les-girls-rib-briefs></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Briefs</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gooseberry Les Girls Rib Briefs</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Les Girls Rib Briefs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sqdDUkFL53nxGYeZKrF3roWzTIA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/les-girls-rib-briefs-fb402f8901ac49fbb534be1f9f4053ac.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gooseberry</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They were made for embracing the soft girl aesthetic.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The waistband can tug a little.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those of you embracing the soft girl aesthetic (or for whom cottagecore is not a phase, but a lifestyle), here’s the 100 percent cotton, delicately ribbed high-rise brief of your dreams. This is “high-waisted underwear that holds everything in place, enhances each feminine curve, and provides full coverage without riding up,” says fashion writer Emerald Elitou. “I promise you, you're gonna love them!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While on some people, the waistband tugs a little, most find these panties extremely comfortable and keep coming back for more. They’re made from ridiculously soft cotton jersey and will move with you throughout your day without the need for spandex, thanks to the pretty and clever ribbing. Last but not least, they come in a little bag that brings them firmly into “treat yo self” territory — and makes them a thoughtful gift for a partner or friend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS-XL | <strong>Colors</strong>: 2 |<strong> 100 Percent Cotton: </strong>Yes |<strong> Style: </strong>Briefs |<strong> Organic: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-boy-short-negative-cotton-mini-boy-short-3-pack></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Boy Short</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Negative Cotton Mini Boy Short 3-Pack</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Negative Cotton Mini Boy Short 3-Pack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/edA2YZ-h5Qap0S9wjEl9RzYjWoI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/negative-cotton-mini-boy-short-3-pack-ddd79a811ad148e894cbf2ac353d118f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Negative Cotton</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re as good under your clothes as they are for lounging or sleeping.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some people find the fabric too lightweight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Boy shorts are such a great invention.

The lace on these Tommy Johns puts a little pretty in these briefs’ functionality, making them the perfect blend of comfy and sexy. They’re made from breathable, sweat-wicking Pima cotton, so they’re an ideal pick for those busy days spent running around, or for wearing under pajamas while you’re on your period.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Happy customers love how these briefs fit on them, with no riding up and no bunching, and say the lace band feels supportive as well as being a welcome style detail. The quality of the lace can be hit or miss, though: On some pairs, it’s more prone to folding over your belly, while on others it won’t. That aside, these fit true to size, so you can order away without fear. Tommy John is so confident you’ll love these that they offer a full refund on the first pair you buy from them if you don’t like them.

These below-belly briefs dip at the front to accommodate your bump but rise up high enough in the back to never fall down (or ride up). The elastic band around the thighs can feel a little tight for some people, but the fabric is so soft and comfy that we’re willing to look the other way this time around.

The fabric blend (or lack thereof) is definitely something to keep in mind when you’re choosing your perfect pair. “Pieces that are 100 percent cotton are breathable and come from natural fibers, so are also recyclable,” says Lightbown. “When blended with elastane, you get the benefits of having extra stretch so the fit will be improved, and it also means they will retain their shape better when washed. However, you forgo the ability for them to be recycled.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like with other underwear fabrics, cotton panties come in all sorts of styles, so you don’t have to wear a brief if that’s not your preference (though of course there are some great ones of those out there).

This is especially true when washing the garment. A bit of spandex can also offer light tummy support.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does all cotton underwear give you a VPL?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Absolutely not! “It depends on the cut of the piece and the density of the fabric,” says Lightbown, noting that a mix of cotton and modal can help avoid VPL (our pick from Victoria’s Secret fits the bill).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, Lau explains, “The VPL aspect depends on how the garment is constructed. If the waistband and legs are lightly bonded or sewn with a thin flat elastic, there may be no VPL. Elastic, if it’s sewn too tightly, will give a VPL.” She recommends boy shorts or thongs to be on the safe side, but our picks for briefs from Natori and Intimissimi are also totally VPL-free.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Iris Goldsztajn</a> is a Paris-born, London-based freelance writer with 10 years of experience covering fashion, beauty, wellness, and lifestyle for the likes of InStyle, Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan, Bustle, Refinery29, and many more.
