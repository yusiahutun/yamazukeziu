Dancers are under constant pressure to perform well, and the ballet world is one that is rife with clichés.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>[2]</span></strong><span type=text> One of those clichés is that all dancers are thin because they are anorexic – which Maria Baranova, prima ballerina of the Bavarian State Ballet in Munich, Germany, says is untrue. Being thin is more a consequence of training, she says. Ballet is a competitive sport in an artistic guise.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>[3]</span></strong><span type=text> A normal working day for Baranova, for example, begins at 10am and ends at 6pm. “We are top athletes. Every performance is like an Olympics for us, we are pushing our boundaries every day.” The job is tough and requires a lot of discipline. “There’s no easy way out. We are live on stage every time – you can’t Photoshop your result,” she says.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>[4]</span></strong><span type=text> Laurent Hilaire, director of the Bavarian State Ballet, says dancers are athletes of the highest calibre who have honed their craft for decades. Ballet companies are aware of the danger of eating disorders like anorexia, says Hilaire – who was a star dancer for the Paris Opera Ballet for two decades – but it does not happen very often any more. “We talk about it, we are concerned about it,” he emphasises.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>[5]</span></strong><span type=text> Ballet academies now offer health programmes. The University of Music and Performing Arts Munich (HMTM) has a performance nutritionist, Dora Meyer, who teaches ballet students “the knowledge and skills to be able to make food choices that support their health, well-being, growth and performance”.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>[6]</span></strong><span type=text> Unhealthy eating habits in the ballet world remain widespread, Meyer says. Dancers are three times more likely than non-dancers to develop an eating disorder. “Studies show that young dancers generally only consume 70 per cent of the recommended energy intake and have a below-average body weight and fat mass.”</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>[7]</span></strong><span type=text> Meyer offers workshops, cooking classes and individual counselling sessions at the university. Twice a year, she provides students with nutritional recommendations and works with them to develop personalised nutrition plans tailored to their lifestyle.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>[8]</span></strong><span type=text> There is also a set minimum weight at HMTM. “It is important that dancers recognise that they are both artists and athletes. Without the right nutrition, performance suffers,” says Meyer. Prima ballerina Baranova also supports maintaining a healthy diet. “You can’t eat air – your body can’t function without fuel.”</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Source: DPA, March 14</span></strong></p><p><h4 type=h4><strong type=strong><span type=text>Questions</span></strong></h4></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>1.</span></strong><span type=text> What does “it” in paragraph 1 refer to?</span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text>______________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p><p><strong type=strong><span type=text>2.</span></strong><span type=text> In paragraph 2, which of the following is a misconception about ballet dancers?</span><br class="Body__StyleBr-sc-1cgoct-9 ibAFpb"><span type=text>A.
