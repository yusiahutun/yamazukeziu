Legally, however, he is the son and heir of Ludovic Ransom, Eighth Earl of Ellesmere.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekeyK7FgN9 data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Outlander season 7: everything you need to know about the story so far</a></p><p id=eH-gAcW12Q data-wc=15><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Outlander's Sam Heughan throwback photo from his 20s will leave you lost for words</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ba4a2628248f-william-outlander-season-7.jpg><p id=e2TpxPcM_gK data-wc=41>William was conceived during season three of Outlander&nbsp;after Jamie was blackmailed by Geneva into taking her virginity before she wed the much older Earl. The one-night-stand occurred during Jamie and Claire's 20-year separation after she'd travelled back through the stones.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3NDclgVLCf data-wc=73>Throughout the series, William has been kept in the dark about his parentage, believing that Ludovic was his father. His mother, Geneva, died shortly after he was born. She had suffered childbirth complications. Upon Geneva's death, the Earl, convinced that the newborn was not his, threatened to throw William out of the window. Desperate to save him, it was Jamie who shot Ludovic and rescued William. The Earl later died of his injuries.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/0599adeaa42a-david-berry-lord-john-grey-charles-vandervaart-william-ransom.jpg><p id=eOFBwnyv_Cx data-wc=28>As a result, from the age of six, William has been raised by Lord John Grey, his legal guardian and the husband of Geneva's younger sister, Isobel Dunsany.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFV52VA_KW9 data-wc=27>Currently, in the series, only a limited number of people know the truth about William's conception, including Jamie's wife Claire, their daughter Brianna, and Lord John Grey.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Who is William Ransom actor Charles Vandervaart?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eOUStle-5tz data-wc=55>Charles Vandervaart will join the cast of Outlander&nbsp;season seven, but you may have seen him in other popular TV series.
