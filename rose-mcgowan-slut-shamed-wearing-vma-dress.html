Then I've got one for you!'" she explained.

"I didn't do it with my hand on my hip to be sexy. Most of the women that are dressed like that on the red carpet, it's a calculated, sexy move to turn people on. Mine was like, 'Iâ€™m gonna f--k with your brain. I'm going to blow your brain up.'

She wakes up screaming at night and soaking wet in the bed and the sheets are wet. She does it every night, like two or three times a night.' I would have terrible nightmares, PTSD stuff. So, we had to talk about it then."</p><p>Regarding her VMA's red carpet look, McGowan said she has no regrets.</p><p>"You know, when you do stuff sometimes on instinct and in a mood, like when a mood overtakes you on, you analyze what it was that brought you to that mood or that choice," she continued. "So, I've certainly had a lot of time to analyze and I'm looking at the timeline. But I completely understand why I did what I did."</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
