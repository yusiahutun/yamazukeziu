Historic Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland, CA is looking for a new owner. As one of the Bay Area's most beautiful art deco venues, the 81-year-old ballroom, that once hosted Frank Sinatra, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington, is for sale. Sweet's Ballroom and concert venue is on the second floor of the J.J. Newberry building and is located at 1933 Broadway in downtown Oakland. Opened in 1924, Sweet's lay dormant from 1980-1998 until local resident Matthew Fox purchased the building and, with developers Phil Tagami & Len Epstein, completed a $2-million renovation to restore the art deco treasure. <a href=../../../oaklands-sweets-ballroom-up-for-sale.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../heart-rate-zone-training.html>Understanding Your Heart Rate Zones Is Important</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
