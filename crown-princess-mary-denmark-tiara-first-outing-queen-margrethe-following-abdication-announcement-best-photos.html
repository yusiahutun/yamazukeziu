A small gold clutch added the finishing touches to Marie's outfit.</p><p id=eRbGVrwMHgz data-wc=73>Margrethe announced her plans to step down as monarch on New Year's Eve. In a statement released on social media and<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;the official royal family website</a>, she said, in part: "I have decided that now is the right time. The 14th January 2024 - 52 years after I followed my beloved father - I will step back as the Queen of Denmark. I leave the throne to my son the Crown Prince Frederik."</p><p id=esa7T3EZ15j data-wc=63>She finished by leaving her well wishes to the future King and Queen, adding: "It is my hope that the new King and Queen will be met with the same trust and devotion which have fallen to my lot.
