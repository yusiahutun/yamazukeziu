You can’t elevate the voices of Black people if you’re not following any. These <a href=#>Black beauty influencers</a> are a good start if you’re a fan of colorful makeup, killer wigs and clutch skincare tips. Who isn’t?</p><p>Take <a href=#>Jackie Aina</a>‘s no-BS approach to makeup. We love it when she calls out brands for their lack of <a href=#>shade representation</a>, saying exactly what we were thinking. And this creates real change in the industry. Or take a look at Shalom Blac’s feed to see what real confidence is. The burn survivor became popular for the way she transformed her scars with makeup but she’s so much more than that. You might know Nyma Tang from her <a href=#>Fenty Beauty</a> campaigns but you’ll learn she’s much more than just a pretty face.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MyBeautyIsBlack_FI3-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jackie-aina.jpg><p>When we speak about <a href=# id=auto-tag_black-beauty data-tag=black-beauty>Black beauty</a> influencers, we’re not just talking about those who identify as women. Black boys and GNC people often get looked over when it comes to big brand campaigns, fancy trips and sponsored posts but things are finally changing. Give those like Tavaris Jefferson and Victor Ramos a follow to diversify your feed in terms of both skin color and gender.</p><p>Below, meet some of our favorites Black beauty stars to follow on Instagram but be sure to check out their YouTube and <a href=#>TikTok feeds</a>, as well.</p><h2>Jackie Aina</h2><p>Aina is known for her honest product reviews and hilarious videos. She’s not afraid to call out a brand for not having an inclusive shade range and she’s made the industry better for it.</p><h2>Nyma Tang</h2><p>Tang might be best known for modeling <a href=#>Fenty Beauty</a>‘s deepest shade, but she’s proved she’s much more than just a pretty face. Watch her videos for ultra-helpful darker skin makeup tips, as well as all the colorful wig inspo.</p><h2>Shalom Blac</h2><p>As a burn survivor, fans flock to Blac’s videos to watch her transform her scars.

If you’re a fan of color, follow him for non-boring beauty.</p><h2>Cydnee Black</h2><p>“The girl with the blue eyes” is Black who was a M.A.C. makeup artist and can blend like no one else. Follow her for all the hair inspo, as well.</p><h2>Alissa Ashley</h2><p>Ashley and her twin sister Arnell slay both together and apart, with colorful makeup looks, a snatched cat-eye and eye-catching braids.</p><h2>Victor Ramos</h2><p>No one transforms himself like beauty vlogger Ramos.
