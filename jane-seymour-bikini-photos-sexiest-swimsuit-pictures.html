Away from the big screen, she enjoys traveling the world, hosting family gatherings at her gorgeous <a href=#>Malibu mansion</a> and flaunting her <a href=#>bikini body</a>. Her swimsuit pictures can brighten up any day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Jane is always turning up the heat with her gorgeous bathing suit looks. The star credited her Mediterranean diet and intermittent fasting for helping her stay bikini-ready in a March 2020 interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>“I felt that there are a lot of people I know who just give up. They have the babies, and they say, ‘OK, I’m done caring about how I look and staying in shape,’” the </span><i><span>Modern Men </span></i><span>alum explained. “And then I think they think that people like me go to exotic spas and do all kinds of special treatments and I don’t do any of that. I think I wanted to show people what would happen if you just did a very simple regimen like I do, where you’re not on any specialty diet, you eat as sensible as you can, everything in moderation.”</span></p><p><span>The Emmy winner maintains her youthful glow by using Crepe Erase products, retinol and applying sunscreen often. Jane previously opened up to</span> <a href=#><i><span>Closer</span></i></a> <span>about aging in Hollywood before her 67th birthday in February 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I feel like I’m 40! I’m really healthy, knock wood,” she said at the time. “I think I’m staying so young because I have these grandchildren that keep being given to me, like, ‘Mom, can you take them?’ And I’m happy to!”</span></p><p><span>The jewelry designer is a ball of energy and loves spending time with her family. Jane is <a href=#>a mom to kids </a></span><b>Katherine Flynn</b><span>, </span><b>Sean Flynn</b><span>,</span><b> John Stacy Keach</b><span> and </span><b>Kristopher Steven Keach</b><span>. She is also a <a href=#>doting grandma</a> and is referred to as “Oma” by her grandkids.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“The grandkids, they’re wonderful,” the </span><i><span>Wedding Crashers</span></i><span> actress told </span><a href=#><i><span>Closer</span></i></a><span> in February 2020. “Actually, one grandkid, Willa … she’s [already] won two acting awards for a movie her mother [Katherine] has directed and written … it’s a short movie called </span><i><span>Towns</span></i><span>, it’s great.”</span></p><p><span>Jane’s grandkids frequently make appearances on her Instagram account. It’s no surprise that they enjoy spending time on the beach just like her! “Life’s just a little bit better when there’s sand between your toes!” Jane captioned an oceanfront snap with one of her grandkids in June 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see Jane’s gorgeous swimsuit photos.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jmKedXaiyurnOrqlmmpmgtq%2B1jKmfqKyfqHq0sdeinKysXajEqrnSrqCtZaCesLXB0Z6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
