I started to get more upset so, finally, I decided to really do something about it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'One of the main things I suffered from was IBS, so bloating has always been a huge issue for me – so much so, I used to look eight months pregnant if I ate the wrong foods.&nbsp;The main triggers for my bloating are melon, fatty foods, stress and fizzy drinks. I felt awful.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I kept seeing people's before and afters from using Boombod on social media and looked on their website. The 7-day challenge aspect of it really appealed to me so I ordered my first box.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was a bit skeptical to begin with, but within days I started to notice a change. During the first week of using Boombod, I must have been two weeks into my diet/workout regime – I was thinking to myself, "I don't think these are going to work,'' but I was SO wrong!</p><img id=i-16f6033fad9f519f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/22/14/16346734-7272191-image-a-23_1563802818704.jpg height=634 width=634 alt="She reveals it also helped beat bloating ¿ a major side effect of IBS ¿ and gave her more energy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>She reveals it also helped beat bloating – a major side effect of IBS – and gave her more energy</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They make me feel incredible. I love the taste, I felt full of energy, in a good mood, and not once did I feel bloated. While taking Boombod, I was still eating my daily balanced diet – so breakfast, lunch and dinner – and I would take these shots at the appropriate times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The main thing I noticed was the fact that I wasn't getting hungry in between meals! Before my diet, I would get hungry and binge snack on anything I could find and always still feel hungry. I also noticed that my bloating had really subsided and I didn't feel bloated at all.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Another thing I've noticed is I have so much more energy – I've been working out four times a week and I don't just want to be sitting down or sleeping, which I used to do a lot before. My whole body is just full of life again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I got engaged in May this year, so with wedding planning on the horizon, it just somehow kick-started me to lose weight and finally be confident and feel sexy again in what I wear and do.

Well, you simply mix each sachet with water and drink it half an hour before your meal. For an extra boost, all three sachets each contain their own unique vitamin blend to help with energy levels, reduce fatigue and maintain hair and skin health.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But the secret is in its main ingredient: glucomannan. This natural fiber makes up each sachet and, containing only 10 calories, helps to reduce appetite, cleanse and decrease bloating.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Boombod contains 95 per cent glucomannan purity – the highest on the market. It is a natural, water-soluble dietary fiber extracted from the roots of the elephant yam. It has been taken daily in China for centuries because of its&nbsp;putative health benefits, and is part of a traditional medicine that has been extracted from the plant.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As well as feeding the friendly bacteria in the gut, it is&nbsp;the only food ingredient with an EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) approved health claim for weight loss.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-medium">They’ve got a massive Buy One Get One FREE Summer Sale running right NOW.

I am a teacher and a single mother so it's hard to even schedule meals. But on the whole it was healthy; I had already cut out fizzy drinks and carbs, but I needed something to help me get in better shape.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I first heard of Boombod on YouTuber Trisha Paytas' Instagram, and had already been thinking how amazing she looked. The 7-day achiever seemed perfect for me and I was sold.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'One of the major reasons I wanted to try it was because it said it helped battle bloating, which I suffer from real bad – especially around my period.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'So, I started the week challenge. On day two, I noticed I wasn't hungry; I didn’t have those late night cravings anymore and I had a boost of energy too. I was full after three eggs and some fruit or yoghurt and I couldn't believe it when I looked at the scales after seven days: 4.5 pounds down! I carried on for a second week as I had bought a BOGOF deal and lost another 5 pounds.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Apart from the weight-loss, I also found that my skin was so much better. We all know&nbsp;lots of water, good hygiene and a proper skincare routine is always the key to great skin, but while taking Boombod, I had no break outs at all.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'However, the best bit about taking the seven-day challenge was the boost it gave my confidence. I had a holiday in Hawaii and felt great!</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's helped to change the way I think about my body. After giving birth, it’s not easy to lose the mommy weight, but this is helping it to go away. I have friends who ask what diet I'm on and all I say is "Boombod". I'd recommend everyone to try the challenge and see what happens for them.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox"><span class=mol-style-medium>Eager to start shaping up and feel great like Elizabeth?&nbsp;Take the 7-day challenge by ordering Boom</span><span class=femail-ccox><span class=mol-style-medium>bod </span></span></span><span class=mol-style-bold><span class=femail-ccox><a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#><span class=mol-style-medium>HERE</span></a></span></span><span class=mol-style-bold><span class=femail-ccox><span class=mol-style-medium> - and you'll get another week's supply for FREE.
