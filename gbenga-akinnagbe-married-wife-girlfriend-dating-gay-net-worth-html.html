I like dogs but I leave so much it would not be possible to have a pet.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Furthermore, when he was asked, “How is being a single man in NYC?" he explained,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“Ah, being single in NYC is a fascinating thing. You see everything. All stages. People who have been single in NYC in decades. People just arriving here. I try to learn from other people’s mistakes. It’s pretty easy to get a date or meet someone. You can sit down and talk to anyone and approach them. Because there are so many of us and the city is so crowded, we are all physically close; no one takes offense because space is so limited. That makes us both approachable and yet harder. It’s an interesting mix.”</p><p>Well, the answer is still same in 2017 too. Akinngbe was asked the same question again in an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a>&nbsp;in October 2017. The actor replied,</p><p>“I’m alone and can start to look at designs for my furniture company, Enitan Vintage.”&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Though he clears the air about his single status, it's not that he opposes&nbsp;marriage.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The stunning actor took to Twitter back on 11 March 2013 and shared his feelings about the odd society that does not hold a positive thought for gay marriage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/Gbenga%20Akkinagbe.PNG ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Considering Gbenga's thoughts about his marriage and works, it is clear that he is in deep love with his passions.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt height=700 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/Gbenga%20Akkinagbe%20designer.jpg width=700 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Caption - Gbenga Akinnagbe as a designer</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Photo Credit -&nbsp;designsponge.com</p><p>The multitalented actor is not only limited to his acting career.
