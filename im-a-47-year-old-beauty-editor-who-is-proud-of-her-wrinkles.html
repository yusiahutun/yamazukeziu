It’s always been a dirty word in the beauty industry. Smooth, crease-free skin has long been the aim of the anti-aging game. After all, the quest for smoothing those lines on our faces generates around <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">$62 billion&nbsp;</a>for the skincare industry each year.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecFVFp0Q5ab data-wc=90>And it’s no wonder that we have been spending so much of our money on anti-aging creams and striving for skin perfection. We simply aren’t used to seeing wrinkles on skin anymore. Thanks to the advancements of aesthetic treatments like Botox, which freezes muscles so skin appears smoother and wrinkle free, crinkly complexions have become a thing to fix, not flaunt. In America alone, between <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">4 to 5 million people get Botox every year,</a> which is a significant increase from the year 2000, which reported less than 800,000 Botox procedures.&nbsp;</p><p id=ev3g1IemvPZ data-wc=102>Social media has also created a society that’s obsessed with so-called perfect skin. We have become accustomed to seeing smooth, flawless complexions all over our feeds. When you consider that <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">100 million photos&nbsp;</a>are posted every single day on Instagram alone, and given that <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">90% of women&nbsp;</a>reportedly use a filter or edit those photos before posting them - there is a warped sense of reality of what skin really looks like in real life. In the flesh. We simply don’t know whether we are looking at real skin, filtered skin or now, what is becoming even more common, AI generated skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQf8yGSFQ6Vx data-wc=59>This week, <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dove</a> launched an extremely powerful and emotional campaign addressing the rise of AI generated images. <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Code</a> predicts that 90% of online content will be AI-generated by 2025 and that currently, 1 in 3 women feel pressure to alter their appearance because of what they see online, even when they know the images are fake or AI-generated.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">The Code | A Dove Film | Dove Self-Esteem Project</a><p id=e7365EnbThFd data-wc=64>Dove’s campaign suggests that the rise of AI poses one of the greatest threats to real beauty, yet I believe it may actually be driving a backlash against skin perfection. In fact, my crows feet and labial lines were the reason why just last week, my Instagram exploded with celebratory comments from women saying how they believe it’s time to see real skin again.&nbsp;</p><p id=eRp0G0WOvJ0e data-wc=93>After sharing <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">this reel&nbsp;</a>about how I am proud to be a Beauty Editor with wrinkles, many of my followers bombarded my DMs with comments like, “I do wish we could normalise ageing,” and “it’s a privilege to age”. And when I suggested we ‘flip the script’ by calling out and celebrating our ‘imperfections’ that come with ageing, my Instagram stories were flooded with observations like ‘I love my laughter lines’ and ‘my skin is the best it’s been in my 40s - bare and beautiful and I appreciate it more than ever.’</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e23YKA_ipr data-wc=11><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>READ MORE: Why it's time to end the pretty privilidge era</a></p><p id=eXlFIV82-5OG data-wc=97>It is moments like these that I am so proud that, during my 26 years working as a Beauty Editor, I have always strived to help women feel comfortable in their skin, and I feel that AI is making this mission more important than ever. When I introduced unretouched beauty imagery to the high street during my time working for the British drugstore chain, Boots, I was adamant that airbrushing on all images should be banned, and that wrinkles and quirks should be celebrated, not blurred away. And just like airbrushing, AI exacerbates this pressure for flawlessness.</p><p id=eFxs6-Euqw3 data-wc=98>And this is why, that I believe that now more than ever, there is a real call for authenticity to help women recognise the beauty of their imperfections. As a Beauty Editor approaching her 50s, I am working hard to shift the focus towards real skin and genuine, authentic beauty by speaking about products and techniques that enhance the skin you are in, not mask it or change it. And in a world that promotes inclusivity, diversity and self acceptance, surely it’s time that more brands encourage us to celebrate our own unique characteristics and champion authenticity too?</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Embracing self-love at 40: how I transformed my life through the power of list making and body positivity" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7e550292b656-mosuitj.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Embracing self-love at 40: how I transformed my life through the power of list making and body positivity" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Embracing self-love at 40: how I transformed my life through the power of list making and body positivity</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm happier than ever at 50 - here's how" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e959c1fb0951-molly-sims.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm happier than ever at 50 - here's how" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm happier than ever at 50 - here's how</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e8ukI-Qhd36></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGxqb2drg3C1zGaYZmxnYsamrdFmpqWcXZeyosHTsmSenJmpvLN51qGmZqGjYr2zu9SdZKieXZ2ys3nWq6Cno5yawHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
