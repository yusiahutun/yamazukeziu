It runs the Android 11 operating system, including Android apps, and feels much more like a tablet in the hand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Plus, even though a Qualcomm Octa-core processor, 4GB of ram, and 128GB of storage aren't specs to be dismissive of, none of that processing power is foreign to iPads or other tablets. The Tab Ultra C didn't feel sluggish for general use, but there were, of course, delays in switching screens because of the display's refresh rate.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Automatically Clear Private Data When You Close Your Browser</a></span></p><p>For example, typing a document showed slight lag. Using Google Docs to write part of this review with the keyboard dock was undoubtedly doable, but it became an issue when trying to write and edit all in a fluid motion. The delay in moving the cursor, typing, and touching the screen all added up to a slower experience than using a laptop. It was also slower than using an <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">iPad with a Magic Keyboard</a>---but Google's Doc app on an iPad has its own issues.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though reading on an e-paper display is often wonderful, typing on one is less compelling. Interestingly, Boox is not the only manufacturer going down this road of turning e-paper tablets into productivity machines. Amazon has a <a href=#>Kindle Scribe</a>, Freewrite has multiple writing products, and Remarkable recently ventured down the paper-like tablet/productivity path.</p><p>None of those examples quite fully overlap, considering the Tab Ultra C's ability to run the Google Play store and use a wide range of Android apps. And even though those apps open a wide range of functionality, the heart of this product is a reading device.</p><h2 id=color-e-paper-versus-monochrome-e-paper>Color E-paper Versus Monochrome E-paper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/33A17D70-E24C-4A44-8344-0357828F4CD0.jpg><p>If, fundamentally, an e-reader of any kind is made for reading, then does it need a color e-paper screen? The quick answer is no, but adding in color makes things really nice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn't Boox's first rodeo in the e-paper tablet world. Last year the company debuted the <a href=#>Tab Ultra</a>, which is nearly identical but doesn't have a layer of color. While that other product worked the same, the Tab Ultra C's pale color layer makes all kinds of tasks more palatable. It adds more distinction to apps and the user interface.</p><p>Browsing the web in black and white is surprisingly difficult. Similarly, skimming book covers, album artwork, and other interface cues most of us take for granted can present more cognitive load when those items are void of color. After my time with the Tab Ultra C, I'm convinced this product needed the feature of color to fully be considered as a viable tablet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/9E6ECB92-ED66-497A-8965-2E2A479F3E92.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I was able to stream the <a href=#>Google I/O 2023 keynote</a> on YouTube. It worked. There were some ghosting and image artifacts, but I had no problem doing it. I wouldn't recommend the Tab Ultra C as a media device to stream Netflix, however.</p><p>I found the experience of browsing the Libby app to check out e-books from local libraries much easier on the Tab Ultra C with color than skimming Kindle's monochrome bookstore. Book covers grabbed my attention easier, and I was able to better decipher images.</p><p>The color overlaid on the Tab Ultra C's screen is a lower resolution and not as bright or vibrant as a traditional display, but the effect does mean things like highlighting a document with the stylus becomes possible.</p><h2 id=boox-tab-ultra-c-in-daily-use>Boox Tab Ultra C in Daily Use</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/9511DA04-D51D-415C-927E-F239E9513B21.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In order to best use different apps, the Tab Ultra C has several different modes of refresh for its display. Those include HD Mode, Balanced Mode, Fast Mode, and Ultrafast Mode. Each is pretty self-explanatory, from the better picture quality and least amount of "after images," or ghosting, to a quick response and less delay, but plenty of ghosting.</p><p>I found it helpful that the Tab Ultra C remembered the refresh mode I changed it to for each app. Rather than a static mode across the entire device, your reading app can be set differently than other ones.</p><p>The Tab Ultra C has a 16MP camera on the back. You might assume this can be used for any kind of picture, but it's for scanning documents. The process worked okay but left a lot to be desired. Unlike scanning a document using Apple's Files app, the Tab Ultra C did not attempt to straighten the image or make it more readable. Cropping and other basic editing are left up to the user.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Writing on a scanned document is great, but it can be a little confusing how to immediately share them or even find those documents later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BCD15BAC-48C3-43E4-8EFA-7D5E0F46AD47.jpg><p>You should be able to get a full day's worth of active use out of the Tab Ultra C. I saw battery life last 6+ hours with continual tablet use. As a general rule, you could probably expect a little better than it would be on a similar-sized 10-inch iPad. If you're only reading on it, you can probably expect more, while streaming YouTube videos will really push through any savings inherent to its e-paper display.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The real battery life benefit I saw was between my uses of the Tab Ultra C. If I leave my iPad unused for three days, there's a good chance the battery will be significantly lower when I come back to it. That wasn't the case with the Tab Ultra C---as I also saw with the Tab Ultra.</p><h2 id=should-you-buy-the-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-c>Should You Buy the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_f3fc3fa3-cdfa-4f5c-872b-754b658256e4-jpg-1.jpg><p>The <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Boox Tab Ultra C</a> starts at $599.99, while the colorless Tab Ultra starts at $40 less at $559.99. For that price difference, the Tab Ultra C is the clear choice. Including the keyboard dock in the package will push the price up to $665.99. But the choice most likely isn't between two Boox devices. It's between an iPad and the Tab Ultra C.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The problem with the Boox Tab Ultra C is that what it's good at is really narrowly focused. It does great outdoors in the sun. Plus, adding a dash of color to an e-reader can be helpful. But it's a pricy product to only excel in limited places.</p><p>Readers and heavy notetakers who only want one device could be satisfied with the Tab Ultra C. Ultimately, however, trying to combine a tablet and e-reader just isn't quite ready for mainstream use yet. This product gets within plausible range, but I would still recommend most people, even avid readers, <a href=#>stick with an iPad</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_f3fc3fa3-cdfa-4f5c-872b-754b658256e4-jpg-1.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C</h5><p class=display-card-description></p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Boox</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhvcmpgaH9wu82yr2aan6TFbsDAm2SupKSnrm6vjKucr6GVrHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
