Her age, job, net worth, family, and residence. And their cute love story, you should definitely read that too!</p><h3><strong>Brooke Gilliam On Making Modern With Brooke And Brice</strong></h3><p>Brooke Gilliam from Making Modern with Brooke and Brice is self-taught. She is taking the role of a builder while her husband Brice contributes to their business as a designer. It was building their own house that gave them the feeling that they could get into the house renovation business.</p><p>Brooke spent her time at the site learning from the subcontractors. The subcontractors weren‚Äôt used to having girls around so they invited her to learn how to make things. So, she ended up learning the trades of the business. She took a couple of projects from her friends and family.</p><p>Word of mouth, they started attracting clients and it became their full-time gig.</p><p>As for Magnolia‚Äôs show Making Modern, one of her neighbors helped them to meet a TV producer (Sarah Kunin, a former producer for ABC) that was moving to Nashville. The producer offered her a chance to create a show and both Brooke and Brice agreed.</p><p>One of the interesting things about their show is they are building a business as the show progresses. But, it has been challenging for them because people reach out to Brooke thinking she is the designer which she calls the ‚Äúindustry norm‚Äù. And, with cameras following around it adds to that challenge and it took them a lot of time to get used to that.</p><p>For Brooke, the final product coming together (construction and TV show production) is surprising.</p><h3><strong>Brooke And Brice Gilliam‚Äôs Relationship</strong></h3><p>Brooke and Brice Gilliam have been married since August 2012.

Brooke told The List, ‚ÄúWe knew we were the one for each other pretty quickly, and we were engaged seven months later and then got married right at that two-year mark of knowing each other. So we‚Äôve been together almost 10 years now‚Äù.</p><p>Brice likes to add twists to the story adding that he was the guy who jumped out of the cake, which Brooke denies because it didn‚Äôt happen. On the contrary, Brice thinks the story sound so much better that way. But, Brooke added that they were planning to re-enact that on their 10-year anniversary.</p><p>But both of them agree that it was love at first sight.</p><p>Brice proposed seven months later, and they got married next year in August 2012. The couple celebrated their 9-year anniversary on 4 August 2021. On their joint account, Brice announced, ‚Äú9 years of the perfect balance ü§ç <a class="oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x jb3vyjys rz4wbd8a qt6c0cv9 a8nywdso i1ao9s8h esuyzwwr f1sip0of lzcic4wl notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@abitofbrooke_</a>‚Äôs ability to bring warmth into any space she enters is what first drew me to her way back when I met her out at the Cadillac Ranch (the real Nashville natives will know).</p><p>He added, ‚ÄúHaving her by my side to ride this crazy wave of life is the most incredible blessing and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world. They may call me the ‚ÄúSmile Creator,‚Äù but little do they know that she is the reason for my smile each and every day. We are truly ‚Äúbetter together.‚Äù Cheers to 9 years, baby.
