The album featured eight songs including BLACKPINK’s pre-single “Pink Venom” (which the group performed at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards) and the main single “Shut Down.” See the full Born Pink track list below.</p><li>“Pink Venom”</li><li>“Shut Down”</li><li>“Typa Girl”</li><li>“Yeah Yeah Yeah”</li><li>“Hard to Love”</li><li>“The Happiest Girl”</li><li>“Tally”</li><li>“Ready For Love”</li><p>Jennie teased the group’s 2022 comeback in an appearance on the variety show, The Game Caterers, in March 2022. “BLACKPINK is also making a comeback soon, I don’t know if I’m allowed to say this, but since I’m the only BLACKPINK member here, I’ll just say it please look forward to it,” she said at the time.</p><p>The group’s management company, YG Entertainment, confirmed the album in a statement in August 2022. “The name for this comeback project is Born Pink, which implies the identity of <a href=# rel=noopener>BLACKPINK</a>, which is never ordinary and will exude a fatal aura,” the statement read. At a press conference for “Pink Venom” on August 19, 2022, BLACKPINK explained the meaning of the song and how it represents the group. “Since our album’s title is Born Pink, we wanted to relay our identity in the song as much as we could,” Jennie said at the time. “Since ‘pink’ and ‘venom’ have contradicting images, we thought they were kind of reminiscent of us… we are named BLACKPINK and contradiction is our charm — we wanted to show that. It’s pink venom, a lovely poison, it’s words that most express us.” Jennie also explained later about how the “essence” of BLACKPINK” is “confidence.” She added, “Some worry that we might stray away from our identity, but we believe it’s the most distinct and clear way to represent us.”</p><p>“It was our sixth anniversary recently, time flies,” Jisoo added. “[Our fans] Blinks have waited for our music and waited for us, so I hope we can enjoy and have fun together for a long time.” Lisa described “Pink Venom” as a way for the group to “raise expectations for the upcoming album’s release and all the good songs there.” The group continued, “I can’t give away everything, but we want to play up our strengths and show us as we are while trying new things [on the album]. Listen to ‘Pink Venom’ and you’ll get a clearer picture of our second album.” Rosé added, “[Our songwriting team] played the song in the studio for us the first time, and it sounded really new to us. There were sounds we had never attempted before so we really rapidly decided to record it and wanted to perform it for everyone soon.”</p><p>Rosé also revealed her reaction when she first heard the “Pink Venom.” “I remember the first time I listened to the song in the studio; it was really new and sounds we never attempted before,” she said. “I just really wanted to record the song right away and show our performance.” Jisoo described “Pink Venom” as a combination of modern hip-hop with traditional Korean instruments like a geomungo, which can be seen in the “Pink Venom” music video.</p><p>Lisa also discussed the “powerful” choreography in the “Pink Venom” music video, and the song’s popular “fang dance” move. “We visualized a fang with our hands which most intuitively expresses the ‘Pink Venom’ concept; Everybody can follow it easily… there’s an impactful dance break at the end [of the music video], and the set is just amazing,” Lisa said.</p><p>The group also talked about why they aren’t concerned with “breaking records.” “Rather than breaking records, we have really focused on our new songs,” Rosé said. Lisa also teased BLACKPINK’s upcoming album and why the group chose “Pink Venom” as their pre-release single. “All our songs are really good…We wanted to show this [song] first to BLINKs,” she said.</p><p>BLACKPINK tickets to the Born Pink World Tour are available on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">StubHub</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vivid Seats</a>.
