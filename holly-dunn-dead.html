She was 59 years old.</p><p>Born Holly Suzette Dunn on Aug. 22, 1957, the singer got her start performing in bands in high school and college before moving to Nashville, where she worked as a demo singer and songwriter before signing with MTM Records.</p><p>She released her self-titled debut album in 1986, and went on to land hits including "Daddy’s Hands," "Love Someone Like Me," "Strangers Again" and "Are You Ever Gonna Love Me," which reached No. 1 in 1989. Dunn scored another No. 1 single with "You Really Had Me Going," but her career cooled off at country radio in the '90s, and she retired from music in 2003 to pursue her other passion, art, leaving Nashville and moving to Santa Fe, N.M.</p><p>Dunn shared her ovarian cancer diagnosis in an<a href=#> interview</a> in June, saying she'd undergone surgery and chemotherapy, but her prognosis was "very bleak." She added that she did not believe in statistics and was leaning on her faith to carry her through.</p><p>"My faith is my rock. But I also draw tremendous strength from my family and my family of friends who have gathered around me in total support," she shared. "Being a Christian, I know that no matter how this chapter ends, I will be OK. Either upright walking on this earth or safe in my Savior’s arms."</p><p><strong>Country&nbsp;Acts Who've Been Affected by Cancer</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoaecocZusNSnpWaclZaxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
