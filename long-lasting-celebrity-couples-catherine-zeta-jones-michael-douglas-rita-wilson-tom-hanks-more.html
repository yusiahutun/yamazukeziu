Their relationship didn't turn romantic until 1996 after Faith ended her engagement to Scott Hendricks.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Following a whirlwind romance, which saw the 'It's Your Love' singer propose several times, the couple got married in his aunt's garden.

I was closeted and very, very afraid that if I talked about being gay, it would be the end of my career. So, I wasn't about to date the most famous lesbian in the world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9b83385cfe90-michael-czj.jpg><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=9b83385cfe90-michael-czj>Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas</h2><p dir=ltr>Aside from a brief split in 2013, Catherine Zeta-Jones and her husband Michael Douglas have been together since 1998, when they met at the Deauville Film Festival.

It's a big process and I guess you find yourself being more in love with these people as time goes by and here it is. We've been going out for almost two and a half years.
