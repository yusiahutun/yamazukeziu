Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.</p><p>There’s a lot of content to consume in the 90 Day Fiancé universe. The original show follows couples who have received a K-1 visa, which is uniquely available to betrothed partners of US citizens. The Other Way is exactly what it sounds like—American couples who move to their partner’s home country. “It’s about love,” 90 Day Fiancé executive producer,&nbsp;Matt Sharp, told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Gold Derby</a> in May 2022 when asked what makes the&nbsp;TLC&nbsp;reality TV&nbsp;series so popular.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/michael-90-day-fiance.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/nikki-justin-90-day-fiance.png><p>“Love is primal, but I think we tapped into a couple of things. One is that this show is incredibly authentic. I’m a huge lover of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelor</a> and that franchise, however, we were one of the first shows to actually tell real stories about ordinary Americans and their love journeys. Also, this show is about this journey with other cultures. When we launched this show in 2014, we were on the ‘love frontier’ of this whole new era of finding people all over the world.”</p><p>He continued: “This is the most diverse show on television,” Sharp asserted. “You can challenge me on it. We featured people from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>51 countries at this point</a>. We have subtitles. We have people that don’t speak the same language and have completely different cultures. We’re trying to tell unique stories every time and when we’re in the casting process we’re evaluating people based on their personalities, backgrounds and their stories, but also we just want to tell unique, fresh, interesting stories.” So who’s still together from <a href=# id=auto-tag_90-day-fiance data-tag=90-day-fiance>90 Day Fiance</a>: The Other Way season five? Read on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=are-sarper-and-shekinah-still-together-from-90-day-fiance-the-other-way>Are <strong>Sarper and Shekinah</strong> still together from 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/90-day-fiance-the-other-way-s5-sarper-shekina-1014x570-1.jpeg><p>Status: Still together</p><p>Are Sarper and Shekinah still together? Yes, it seems so, though their relationship seems to have a few red flags. In a recent Instagram post, Sarper pleaded with his followers to help him find his missing son, who he believes was born in 1999. Along with sharing the story of he and Shekinah’s “big and unusual love”, he also wanted the platform of the show to help find his child.</p><p>On Instagram in early November 2023, Sarpar made a desperate plea to his followers to help him find his missing son, which he talks about on the show. “In 1998 I met with a Russian woman called Alina in Antalya in a hotel. I was 19 and she was 35 at the moment. We were together for a week. While I had no mobile phone at that time, the only contacts we had were emails..”</p><p>“After a while I had an email from her saying that she was pregnant, arranged that deliberately and wanted a kid without marriage.. We kept mailing.. In every email she wrote that she had no expectations from me and was just giving information. She later reported that she had an ultrasound and learned the child was a boy. We kept mailing till 7-8 months of pregnancy. Then I was so scared that she would come and give the baby to me, and deleted my account and disappeared.. I was just so young for such a responsibility.”</p><p>“Years later, I came to my senses and decided to find Alina and the baby. But i couldn’t find my old email. I tried to reach the hotel, but it was renovated and changed name.. I am told there were no previous years’ records. I dont know her family name and what name she gave to my son.</p><p>My biggest dream is to see my son at least once in my lifetime. To be honest along with our big and unusual love with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>@shekinah.garner</a>&nbsp;this was another motive for me to be involved on this show. It is an international show and has a big audience worldwide. But as I learned, due to conflict with Russia, American networks are not broadcasting there. So I had only two options left ; DNA pool check and social media. As DNA tests are illegal and forbidden in Turkey, the only hope I am left with is SOCIAL MEDIA.”</p><p>During a trip to Turkey, Shekinah, an aesthetician based in LA, met Sarper, a model and personal trainer. Their sexual chemistry was off the charts and after only two days, they both fell head over heels for each other. “You know how people usually say, ‘You had me at hello?’ Sarper had me at highlighter,” she said in a confessional. “He was wearing highlighter on our first date. And I noticed it down the bridge of his nose, and I was like, ‘This man is wearing makeup. He’s wearing makeup on a date with me. That is so cute!’”</p><p>She continued: “He is just everything that I’ve looked for. He’s sweet, he’s thoughtful, he’s really caring, and our sex life is just, like, out of this world. It’s insane.” After just a year of dating, Shekinah and Sarper decided to take a major step in their relationship by having the aesthetician move to Turkey. “My attraction and connection with Sarper is so strong that I’m willing to leave this entire life that I’ve built in Los Angeles to go and be with him,” she explained.</p><p>Shekinah’s friends and family try to warn her that Sarper is really a playboy, and she is repeating a pattern of falling for an attractive man despite the red flags, but Shekinah insists that this time is different.</p><p>Once abroad, Shekinah tried to lay down ground rules for Sarper, but he balked at her efforts to control him. The more time they spend together, the more shocking discoveries are made, leading the two lovebirds to question how well they really know each other. The couple got into an argument during the September 18 episode after Sarper failed to replace a mattress he’s had for 12 years. “That is still your old bed,” Shekinah complained. “Before I came here, I said please get a new bed, because I don’t want to sleep in a bed that other women have slept in.”</p><p>She explained further: “About a month before I moved to Turkey, Sarper told me that he had been with about 2,500 women, and I thought it was a typo,” she said. “I’d never even heard of anyone being with half that many people. I just really hate the mental image of wondering what caused the headboard to look the way that it does.”</p><p>She later vented in a confessional that “clearly he doesn’t take it seriously when I tell him to do something, so he’s gonna find out now. And if he wants to sleep in his gross bed, he can do that. Or he can join me on the couch. I don’t care. But all I know is I’m not sleeping in that bed, and we have to get a new one as soon as possible.” Rest assured, the couple is still together and posts each other on <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.instagram.com/p/CwvJ91lxjFl/>Instagram</a> constantly. In fact, they posted videos of them kissing right before the finale.</p><p>Meanwhile, some fans <a href=# rel=nofollow>don’t believe their relationship</a>. One speculated on Reddit: “Can you actually picture them spending a day alone in the apartment without their makeup on and just hanging in their pajamas, cuddling and reading on a Sunday afternoon? Thats what real relationships do. This one is for the camera.” Who are we to know for sure?</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
