At 74.5 million iPhones sold, it was a tall order even for big suppliers like Foxconn to meet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In a statement in English, Foxconn said: "All overtime work is also compensated at mandated rates that are higher than standard working hours."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It added that, like all other manufacturing companies, Foxconn was "continuously challenged" by employees' desire to work overtime to increase their income.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It said it provided professional counselling and other support services for its employees 24 hours a day and seven days a week to help them address any work-related or personal challenges.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The record shows that these services are working and they are saving lives each and every day."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company's statement in Chinese, carried by major news websites including Sina and Tencent, dealt with Guo's "surprising" remarks in an even more direct manner.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Mr Guo Jun has never come to any of our factories â€¦ throwing out this conclusion, it's hard to convince anyone," it said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chang Kai, a professor at Renmin University's labour and human resources school, said: "It's a good thing that the ACFTU showed their attitude, but it's just the first step.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Next, the union should suggest solutions," Chang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Foxconn doesn't have a union chosen by workers at all."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: iPhone supplier staff feel the strain</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyivtOimqWdX2aEcXyRb3Bom5ieu6K%2FjKidn6GTnq6tedOrmJ2dXaq7qrvNZpqroaSesKq%2FxKxknqSVmMGzu82imqxlnZa4pr6Mn6axm5%2Bjuw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
