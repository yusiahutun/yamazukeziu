Policy changes and a troubled housing market are the two main culprits, they said.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Investors are willing to wait for policy clarity and stability in economic indicators before returning to the market, or rely on alternative offshore assets as proxies if they choose to stay invested in China’s economic recovery story.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“China is very much a second-half of the year story for us,” Stefanie Holtze-Jen, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific at Deutsche Bank Private Bank, said in an interview. “What an investor needs to see is repeated macroeconomic data shifts, some consistency. Until then, there will be a bit of hesitation.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/9cfd3c04-5959-4321-b925-3a3315e54c94_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The German private bank, which manages about US$593 billion of client assets globally, took a position on Chinese equities in February after seeing signs of stabilisation, but abandoned the trade last month because fragile market sentiment was not likely to sustain the momentum, it concluded.</p>China entered the second quarter with a mixed bag of economic outcomes. Reports this week showed first-quarter growth of 5.3 per cent <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">surprised to the upside</span></a>, while credit growth, industrial production, retail sales, housing starts and home prices were sluggish or weak.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The MSCI China Index, which tracks more than 700 stocks listed at home and offshore, has declined 35 per cent since 2021, compared with a 6.2 per cent gain for the S&P 500 and a 33 per cent rally in the Nikkei 225 Index. Despite state-led market intervention, the gauge has lost 1.8 per cent this year, while the S&P 500 and the Nikkei 225 advanced by 6 and 15 per cent, respectively.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Everyone hates the market’: Ray Dalio says time is right to buy Chinese stocks</span></p></a></h3>Investors have pulled their money from the market again, as benchmark stock indices wobbled. Global funds have sold more than 11 billion yuan (US$1.5 billion) worth of mainland stocks this month through April 15, halting <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">inflows in February and March</span></a>, according to Stock Connect data.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Policymakers in Beijing are stepping up their efforts to support the market, including issuing unprecedented guidelines for better market transparency and risk-management. That means there are still opportunities for tactical trades in Chinese stocks, Deutsche Bank’s Holtze-Jen said, in state-favoured sectors such as renewable energy.</p>Swiss private bank Lombard Odier <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">removed its strategic allocation to Chinese assets</span></a> earlier this year. The market’s underperformance means that there is no imminent incentive to return, said John Woods, chief investment officer and head of investment solutions for Asia.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/83fdd1bf-ae46-4d97-9849-e0a8d1c28463_fb4f1e1c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Consumer sentiment, retail sales and home sales are all really “quite depressed”, and consumers are nowhere to be seen in the current stage of economic recovery, Woods said. “We have to wait and see if the government is able to provide sufficient stimulus, both monetary and fiscal” before animal spirits are reignited, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our clients would be looking at its underperformance relative to global markets as being a little concerning,” Woods said. “It’s hard to see an immediate bounce back from a structural perspective” as the property challenges persist and consumption remains subdued, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bear-market rallies are as frequent as they are fleeting and they rarely provide a credible opportunity to build a long position, Lombard Odier said in a report earlier this month. Policy settings and policymakers have replaced earnings and valuations as market drivers, creating a greater element of unpredictably, it added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As proxies, investors could buy the makers of European luxury goods as a bet on China consumption story. Base metals like copper and bulk commodities like the Australian dollar could be a way to participate in a classic stimulus-fuelled cyclical rebound, Lombard said in the report.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Deutsche Bank, structural issues in the property sector are weighing on China’s long-term growth trajectory. To boost consumption and contain further home price declines, China’s central bank could loosen monetary policy further, to the detriment of the nation’s currency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m worried about the sentiment, the macroeconomic data coming in patchy, and also that the [fund] flows will not follow,” Holtze-Jen said. “It’s prudent to step away and monitor for the time being until this is stabilising.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kr7a%2FyKecrKtfoq6zt8StqmiZoqm2pLjEaGprbWlofnd706uYnaGenHqlvsCgpqdlk522r7HSnmSsrJ%2BYuLR5wKucZquVmLyvsIyhmKWeXajBsL7YZpueraSosKmxjLCfoqSVYrmwucGaqZ1ln5m2pr6MrJyeq12orqex0WaZnqyj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
