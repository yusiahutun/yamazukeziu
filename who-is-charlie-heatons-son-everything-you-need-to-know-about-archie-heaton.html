Here’s everything you need to know about the adorable Archie Heaton.</strong></p><p>Fans of the hit Netflix series “Stranger Things” have been curious about Charlie Heaton’s son since they knew of his existence. Charlie rose to fame playing Jonathan Byers, and since then, he has achieved much success in his acting career.</p><p>He received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2017 and was nominated for the same award in 2018. He was also nominated for a Teen Choice Award for Choice Scene Stealer and another Screen Actors Guild Award in 2020.</p><p>Despite Charlie’s success in Hollywood, he still tries to make time for his son, Archie Heaton.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_Charlie_Heatons_Son_Archie_Heaton></span>Meet Charlie Heaton’s Son, Archie Heaton<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Archie Heaton was born on May 19, 2014, in England, and he is a Taurus. He is well-known due to his parents, Charlie and the Japanese musician Akiko Matsuura.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3.png><p>Archie Heaton is a bright-eyed boy raised by his mother in London. Despite his parents splitting soon after birth, Archie is lucky enough to spend time with his father. He is a budding athlete and is interested in soccer.</p><p>While Archie’s parents have stated that they want him to choose his profession, they would be thrilled if he attended college and obtained a degree. Archie is active, spending most of his free time playing sports with his friends.</p><p>But he also enjoys playing video games on his PlayStation 4. Archie is a bright student, excelling in math. However, his father hopes to spark an interest in the film industry by taking him to local theaters and cinemas.</p><p>In addition to his love for sports and academics, Archie has a soft spot for animals. Although his parents have not gotten him a pet, he has visited animal shelters and zoos.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Archie_Heatons_Parents_Are_Accomplished_in_Their_Fields></span>Archie Heaton’s Parents Are Accomplished in Their Fields<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Archie Heaton’s parents are both talented individuals with impressive careers in the entertainment industry. Charlie Heaton is a renowned musician and actor from England. He is part of the cast of the popular Netflix series “Stranger Things” and has also starred in acclaimed movies like “Shut In” (2016) and “Marrowbone” (2017).</p><p>Archie’s mother, Akiko Matsuura, is an expert drummer and vocalist with a successful music career. She gained attention in the public eye when she began dating Charlie Heaton.</p><p>Despite ending the relationship with Charlie due to personal struggles, Akiko remains a prominent figure in the music industry and has a net worth of $1 million. On the other hand, Charlie’s net worth is estimated at over $300,000. Also, both of his parents have a significant social media presence and fans globally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Archies_Parents_Meet_and_Where_Are_They_Now></span>How Did Archie’s Parents Meet and Where Are They Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Charlie met Akiko before he rose to fame as an actor. At that time, they were both part of the noise rock band Commanechi. Charlie was the drummer, and Akiko was the frontwoman. It was during their year-long tour that Charlie fell in love with Akiko.</p><p>The former bandmates are no longer together, and the actor has been dating his “Stranger Things” co-star Natalia Dyer since 2016. The reason why Charlie and Akiko’s relationship ended is unknown, as the dad-of-one is tight-lipped about his personal life. But there have been speculations that the 13-year age gap between the former couple played a role.</p><p>Despite the breakup, Archie’s parents have a positive co-parenting relationship. It’s clear that they both have a deep love for their son and prioritize his well-being above all else.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Does_Charlie_Heatons_Son_Live_With></span>Who Does Charlie Heaton’s Son Live With?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Archie primarily lives with Akiko in London, with Charlie visiting him occasionally.

His is a more complicated story as his life of crime, more than his career, took him away from his kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZpuYlr%2BttcRmn56ZpKS7tHnSqKVmnaaav7rAx6KloGWppMJuusSem2asn2K4r7vWZpibp6WpeqK%2BwqGgnmWYmq61u81o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
