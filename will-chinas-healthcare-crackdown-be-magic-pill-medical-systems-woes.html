Then came the market reforms of the 1980s, granting hospitals a high degree of autonomy over charges and coverage in return for less funding from the state. The change saw <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">healthcare shift</span></a> from public welfare into more of a business model, drawing <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">widespread complaints</span></a> over unaffordable and sometimes inaccessible services for vulnerable people.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rent-seeking became rampant, as pharmaceutical sales teams offered generous kickbacks to doctors and hospital administrators, who in turn spent lavishly on expensive drugs and equipment.

It implemented centralised procurement, set bulk purchases of drugs at fixed prices, introduced pay ceilings for doctors and linked the salaries of hospital management with how much they cut costs.</p>Doctors were also asked to switch from premium drugs by multinationals to cheaper local generics, and prescribe from a pool of inexpensive drugs for common illnesses and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">chronic diseases</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, any unused medical pension funds were distributed to hospitals as rewards to encourage doctors to do a better job with the minimum amount of money possible.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In official rhetoric, the reform was hugely successful. President Xi Jinping, who visited Sanming in 2021, praised the reforms of “showing the true value of ‘people first’” as he called on governments across the country to follow its lead.</p>Fast forward to this summer and the launch of a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">sweeping anti-corruption campaign</span></a> targeting hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and insurance funds, delivering initial results similar to those of the Sanming model. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/02/16/clean_0.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:07</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Chinese retirees hold rare protest over cuts in healthcare insurance</p><p>Chinese retirees hold rare protest over cuts in healthcare insurance</p>Beijing has not explained the timing for the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">latest crackdown</span></a>, observers said concerns over a slowdown of the economy had put pressure on the leadership.

But experts have questioned whether it has gone far enough.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the recent anti-corruption crackdown, Amy Zhu, a neurologist in eastern China, said many of her colleagues who used to frequently attend medical conferences had stopped taking part and pharmaceutical sales representatives had stopped their sales calls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Zhu said the ongoing blitz had had little impact on frontline doctors like her and she was not aware of any active investigations against her supervisors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/02/16/clean_0.jpg>Pharmaceutical companies have been known to spend generously on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">promotional activities</span></a> with hospitals to boost sales.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to data from Wind, a business tracking platform in China, among the more than 5,000 listed companies in the country last year, about 1 per cent, or 57 companies, had sales expenses accounting for more than half of their revenue. Among them, 40 were pharmaceutical companies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In May, health authorities issued a directive to “correct the abnormalities” and banned junkets disguised as academic conferences. Last month, at least 10 medical conferences and forums were postponed, including those organised by high-profile associations such as local branches of the Chinese Medical Association.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A marketing consultant at a pharmaceutical company, who requested anonymity, said they had stopped all promotional events with hospitals, including doctor visits and academic conferences. His team is now focusing on academic training as it keeps a close watch on the campaign.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The consultant, who has worked as a sales representative for major brands, said he had witnessed at least three anti-corruption campaigns in his more than 20 years in the industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This latest round came because the government is trying to save medical pensions, as the Covid-19 pandemic had cost a lot of resources,” he said.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">You should either have a real public hospital, with sufficient funding, or you turn them into private hospitals to compete in the marketYanzhong Huang</figure>Previously, the best known corruption case in the industry was the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">GSK scandal</span></a>, where the China branch of the global drug maker GlaxoSmithKline pleaded guilty to paying bribes to hospitals and doctors to promote its products. In 2014, it paid one of the biggest fines in Chinese history, 3 billion yuan (US$411 million).<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the marketing consultant was worried the latest campaign could go overboard.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Drug companies and their sales have a role to play in linking how a drug is developed and how it is used by the doctor,” he said. “Doctors need to be informed about the drugs. This link will not disappear.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile Zhu, the neurologist, said more emphasis was now being placed on the national policy of centralised buying and the use of drugs for each hospital. Doctors were now given instructions over the proper use of drugs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was an open secret that doctors had their hands in the pot through kickbacks from prescribing expensive and unnecessary drugs and hospitals made their profits with costly diagnoses and examinations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Now, we do not prescribe any examinations or drugs unless necessary,” she said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s patients and medical staff pay price when healthcare is corrupt</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But others say the campaign has not addressed the crux of the problem – that public hospitals do not receive sufficient funding from the government, thereby forcing them to turn to profit-driven behaviours. Experts say the crackdown shifted the focus away from the government’s responsibility.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hoping to make up for the healthcare budget deficit, in the 1990s Beijing drastically cut back the central government’s share in the nation’s total healthcare expenditure from 36 per cent to 15 per cent. The move forced many hospitals to find their own ways to make up for the shortfalls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While on paper the hospitals are only allowed a profit margin from medical services to a maximum of 15 per cent, many hospitals have to struggle to make ends meet, using methods such as mark-ups on medicines and check-up fees.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shawn Lin, a heart surgeon of a leading hospital in Fujian, said the anti-corruption campaign could only tackle the problem of the personal greed among the hospitals, and stop corrupt directors and pharmaceutical company managers. But, he said, it did not address the systemic issues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese hospitals had been playing the “cat and mouse” game for decades to remain financially viable, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“At first, hospitals increased the mark-ups on drugs to generate revenue. Then the national medical reform clamped down on the pricing of the hospitals. This drove the hospitals to make money by prescribing more check-ups, such as MRIs, even if they were not necessary. The authorities in turn followed with a new order to regulate such behaviours,” Lin said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/15/dcdd9afe-9d36-4efd-9295-2b9b8b2c90ed_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Multiple people interviewed for this article expressed frustration at being a doctor in a system that required a great deal of training and overtime but offered little pay in return.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One source said that a doctor would probably be over 40 and working 10 to 12 hours a day before they could reach a stable position in the system.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said the system was bound to breed corruption.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You should either have a real public hospital, with sufficient funding, or you turn them into private hospitals to compete in the market,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He expected the latest crackdown would end soon, adding there was little sign that the leadership would institute substantial changes to the system.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last week at a medical forum, Guo Yanhong, an official with the National Health Commission, cautioned that the anti-corruption campaigns should not go too far in affecting the normal pay of medical staff, discouraging them from taking part in professional conferences, and should not expand arbitrarily in scope.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other observers said it was possible that China would push for reforms along the lines of the Sanming model after the current campaign has ended, but it would be a difficult path.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/01/16/web.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">04:34</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Hospitals and pharmacies quiet again: How rural China survived the Covid-19 surge</p><p>Hospitals and pharmacies quiet again: How rural China survived the Covid-19 surge</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">James Wu, a Guangdong heart surgeon who now works at a private hospital, said that kind of model would see good doctors eventually leaving public service due to the salary cap.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I moved to the current private hospital because of the better pay, after 20 exhausting years at a public hospital. I used to perform four to five heart operations every day, but now I only do two to three daily. My pay is much higher, allowing me to finally afford a car and a house,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Furthermore, he said most Chinese-made drugs were not as competitive with imported drugs in terms of quality. So if the government kept pushing the Sanming model, patients who could afford the better quality, expensive drugs may suffer because they would not be given the option of buying the imported drugs, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Huang observed that medical reforms might not even be pushed after the campaign, noting that during the latest crackdown, state media has often linked individual corruption cases with the public’s difficulty to access cheap, high-quality healthcare.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Previously, the government wanted to reform public hospitals and encourage private hospitals to be more competitive, but during the past three years of the coronavirus pandemic, public hospitals were given more responsibilities, acting as designated hospitals for treatment and quarantine centres, while many private hospitals went broke.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“During three years of Covid-19, the reforms have not advanced and even backtracked,” Huang said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Mandy Zuo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyxu8uiq6Kbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2NngHWCknFmsKGcoXqktMinmKxlmJqurcDHnJirnV2Yv6Kvyp2msKZdl7JuucCgoJxloJ65rXnMnpuim5GherTF0q2cpqtdrLymvw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
