It wasn’t real magic; it was a trick, Jessada, a biology lecturer at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University realised.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So he set out to prove it. The monk’s pot, he noticed from watching a video of the event, was oddly shaped, with a large, flat rim attached to a round bowl, resembling an upturned flying saucer. The vat, Jessada surmised, had been made with an inner layer for insulation against the heat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his lab, Jessada half-filled a jar with water, poured palm oil in it, and placed the jar on a hot plate. He waited a while and found he could still dip a finger safely into the oil on top, as the water absorbed the heat. The oil only seemed to be boiling because of air bubbles from the water rising to the top.</p>“Many monks have been using this kind of trick for years,” Jessada says. “They blacken the name of <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/07/04/26b629fa-3f4b-11e6-8294-3afaa7dcda6c_486x.JPG?itok=TQxYeRcy">Buddhism by continuing to deceive people for fame and fortune.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The lecturer posted his findings on social media, amassing a large following, and demonstrated them on a popular television programme. Jessada had debunked yet another scam perpetrated by dishonest “holy men” on a unsuspecting public. “Thai society is mired in a culture of superstitions,” he says. “I am trying to change that.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The biologist is one of Thailand’s best-known science popularisers who runs a YouTube channel called Wittaya Tasawang (“Open Your Eyes with Science”). Jessada has been on a public mission for years to debunk alleged cases of miracle-working and supernatural phenomena, and he hasn’t flinched from demystifying some of the nation’s most enduring and widely cherished myths.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every autumn during the Bangfai Phayanaak (“Naga fireball”) festival in northeastern Nong Khai Province, mysterious fireballs appear over the Mekong River. Locals insist they’re the work of the Naga, an otherworldly serpent that lurks in the river’s murky waters. Jessada says the fireballs are neither mysterious, nor are they fireballs: they are red flares fired into the night sky from across the river in Laos, for the benefit of Thais picnicking in expectation of a “miracle”, which often materialises on cue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How does he know? He asked a friend to film a fireball sighting and send the footage to him. In the clip, posted on his YouTube channel, even the popping sounds of flares being fired from a gun can be heard just as several rising red dots appear in the sky. “Thai people are very gullible and I feel it’s my duty to help foster scientific and critical thinking,” Jessada says. “Younger people tend to be quite receptive.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He regularly tours the countryside to give well-attended lectures at secondary schools and colleges to wean Thais off the habit of reflexively attributing supernatural causes to any phenomena they don’t understand. “If I don’t speak up, people will continue to believe that [seemingly mysterious phenomena] can’t be explained scientifically,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The scientist recently debunked a myth on his own campus. Part of the pavement at Chulalongkorn University – one of the country’s top-ranked educational institutions – was found to be marked with coiling, zigzagging patterns. The marks were found beside a pair of decorative plaster Nagas that adorn balustrades at the faculty of arts building.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several students and lecturers concluded that one of the sculptures had come alive in the night and slithered around in the moonlight. Students began praying to the statues for good grades, while members of the public arrived in droves to light joss sticks for the plaster serpents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jessada investigated and discovered that the marks had been left by a high-pressure hose used by cleaners. “This happened right outside my office. Even some of my colleagues thought it had been the Naga,” he recalls with a chuckle. “Can you believe it?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although Thailand has come a long way economically in past decades, magical thinking continues to permeate all levels of Thai society. It manifests in a host of superstitions, from magic tattoos to incanted spells. Even those in charge of the country subscribe to them. During a recent press conference Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the mercurial general who seized power in a coup two years ago, unbuttoned his shirt to show off the cascade of magical amulets he wears around his neck to enhance his powers and protect him from misfortune.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/07/04/29d2640a-3f4b-11e6-8294-3afaa7dcda6c_486x.JPG?itok=j3xOx4vn">Such charms did little to protect his predecessor Yingluck Shinawatra, however, who was deposed in Prayuth’s coup and faces criminal charges linked to a rice subsidy scheme.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In seeking to spread the virtues of rationalism in the kingdom, Jessada has his work cut out for him. He isn’t the only Thai scientist doing it, though.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Weerachai Phutdhawong, an associate professor of organic chemistry at Kasetsart University, is another popular, media-savvy debunker. A soft-spoken man with thick spectacles and a mop-top, Weerachai may not look like a typical nonconformist, but he doesn’t shy away from stepping on toes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’ve been insulted and threatened for exposing charlatans,” he notes matter-of-factly. “One monk was even trying to come after me.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That monk was Phra Ajarn Cha (”Venerable Teacher Cha”), who recently gained fame in the southern province of Nakhon Sri Thammarat for allegedly sweating red crystals. His superior spiritual virtues rivalled those of ancient Buddhist sages, it was claimed, and the monk’s drops of blood miraculously solidified into crystals, exiting through his shaven pate. The “sacred relics” duly became much sought-after lucky charms among superstitious Thais.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Weerachai was sceptical. He acquired a few beads to test them in his lab. His verdict: the “magic crystals” were in fact made from synthetic polymer. They were simple plastic pellets. He went public with his finding, drawing Arjan Cha’s ire. “Monks like him sell belief in themselves and use tricks as signs of their spiritual powers,” Weerachai says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By exposing the monk as a fraud, the chemist gained many new fans and a few enemies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/07/04/22ca055a-3f4b-11e6-8294-3afaa7dcda6c_486x.JPG?itok=gycbP98T">Entire pilgrimage industries can sprout up locally around the aura of holiness that “magic monks” acquire through their presumed miracles. “These monks practise a commercialised form of superstition in the guise of Buddhism,” says Weerachai, a practising Buddhist who has twice been a monk for short spells. “They prey on people’s ignorance and exploit their tendency to believe in miracles.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It isn’t just monks who do so. Last year, a woman in Phatthalung Province made national headlines for reporting that mysterious fires kept erupting spontaneously around her home, much to her family’s dismay. Reporters flocked to the house. So did a group of mediums, dressed in imitation tiger pelts, who declared the culprit to be a poltergeist, the ghost of a mischievous child haunting the premises. Necromancers tried to exorcise the baleful spirit, but to no avail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/07/04/3763fd7c-3f4b-11e6-8294-3afaa7dcda6c_486x.JPG?itok=yZhwx5aL">Weerachai stepped in, encouraging a television crew to place hidden cameras around the house. One of those cameras soon captured footage of the woman furtively setting fire to a piece of cloth before leaving in haste to alert her relatives. Case solved.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The woman, who had been soliciting donations from the public, wasn’t too pleased about Weerachai’s intervention. She threatened to sue the scientist for defamation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Thai people have to learn to think critically so they won’t be taken in so easily,” Weerachai says. Jessada concurs. “The answers [to puzzling phenomena] must come from science, not from rank superstitions,” he says. “That’s the only way we can become a truly modern nation.”</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: monk-y business</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLa4066pnmeRp8Gqr8ueZmpxaGl%2BdX2OprCtoF2XwrTAxKuqZqyYlrZuv8KinKesmajBtHnDnpmupptiwLixwK2gp59dmL%2B6v9Oao6xlkqS2rbXNoGSooZxirq%2BwjKiroZ2i</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
