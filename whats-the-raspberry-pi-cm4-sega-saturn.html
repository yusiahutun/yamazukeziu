Some games were tested by ETA Prime, such as "Panzer Dragoon" that ran at 45 FPS at 1.5GHz. The game, "Croc" ran almost up to 50FPS, again without overclocking. To improve performance, a CPU cooler and heatsink on the PCB could be used.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fantastic DIY RetroPie Game Stations You Can Build in No Time</a></span></p><p>Doing so, it could be possible to run games at 2GHz. With that said, similar to playing retro games on a Raspberry Pi 4, a whole heap of retro games from NES, SNES, NEO GEO, PS1 can be played at full speed.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=embark-on-a-nostalgia-trip>Embark on a Nostalgia Trip</h2><p>Before you get started with the CM4 Sega Saturn, be sure to read up on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Retropie’s official documentation</a>.</p><p>This guide has plenty of detailed information on first installation, getting started, arcade, emulators, ports, controllers, advanced configuration, RetroArch, EmulationStation, troubleshooting tips, and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiuoZmkqHq1tMRmqZqroJeys77YZqeiZZOigW6%2FxKCYZquRqcKzuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
