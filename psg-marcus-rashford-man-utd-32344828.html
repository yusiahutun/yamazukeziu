Rashford signed a new five-year deal with United last summer worth £350,000 – that is supposed to keep him at Old Trafford until 2027.</p><p>But he is enduring a miserable season both on and off the pitch, which has led to speculation he could leave United this summer. He has failed to find his best form, and found himself in hot water with boss Erik ten Hag following a drinking binge in Belfast which forced him to miss training and an FA Cup tie at Newport.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'Marcus Rashford must show his desire on the pitch – and Erik ten Hag is responsible too'</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>Man Utd icon Ryan Giggs has been working in secret unannounced football role all season</a></b></p><span class=disclaimer-text>This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.</span> <a href=#>Learn more</a> Watch TNT Sports on Amazon Prime here <a class=affiliate-title href=# rel=nofollow>Sign Up to Amazon and TNT to get a free trial</a> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30976634.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_tnt.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>As well as the Champions League, TNT Sports will also be offering sports fans access to games across the Premier League, Europa League, Serie A and much more.</p><p>You can also watch the biggest events in boxing, UFC, WWE and get exclusive action from MLB.</p><span class=price><p>£29.99 per month on top of £8.99 per month Amazon Prime subscription</p></span><span class=info>Amazon</span> <a class=buynow-button href=# rel=nofollow>Buy Now</a><p>Rashford issued a statement last month insisting he was still full committed to United. He hit back at his critics and told them never to question his desire to play for his hometown club.</p><p>But it's understood PSG bosses remain determined to try and sign Rashford. Chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaïfi regards the 26-year-old forward as the long-term replacement for Kylian Mbappe, who has agreed to join <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Real Madrid</a> this summer.</p><p>It remains to be seen if PSG can tempt Rashford to leave United, who value Rashford closer to the £100m mark. But the French champions can offer Rashford a fresh start at one of Europe's richest clubs, and will be willing to hand him a deal in the region of £500,000-a-week.</p><p><b><i>Should United cash in on Rashford?

Rashford, who has had a strained relationship with United boss Ten Hag, has scored just seven goals this season in 34 club appearances.</p><p>He is under growing pressure to rediscover the form he needs to be included in Gareth Southgate's England squad for this summer's Euros in Germany too. It remains to be seen if he'll be selected in the squad on Thursday for March's international break.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cLzSoGSmmaKYwrR50ZqqoZ6fp7FuucCnZK6slGKAc3%2BTbW9rcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
