A flood of calls to representatives angered lawmakers before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce advanced the bill in a 50-0 vote.TikTok, a subsidiary of ByteDance, struck out on <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">X, formerly Twitter</span></a>, by rhetorically asking, “Why are Members of Congress complaining about hearing from their constituents? Respectfully, isn’t that their job?” ByteDance, however, has largely remained quiet on the matter except to deny a Wall Street Journal report that Zhang Yiming, who founded the company in Beijing in 2012, had been in touch with former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick about a TikTok acquisition.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">State media blasts ‘anti-China show’ as US lawmakers seek to force sale of TikTok</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The more aggressive push from TikTok quickly received praise in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of nationalist tabloid Global Times, said in a Sunday post on X that he supports “TikTok’s tough response”.
