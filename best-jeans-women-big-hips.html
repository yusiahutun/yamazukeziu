Thankfully, the stiff styles of old are no longer the only options on the market.

While they offered a ton of recommendations, they all agree that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Good American Good Waist Crop Raw Hem</a> is the ideal pair for nearly everyone thanks to its timeless fit that is comfortable and accentuates curves.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the 9 best jeans for wide hips.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-good-american-good-waist-crop-raw-hem></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Good Waist Crop Raw Hem</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=2400 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Good Waist Crop Raw Hem" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-zJ1ZA-_Xrrfy3BWiZRy2n3w6GQ=/fit-in/1500x2400/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GoodAmericanGoodWaistCropRawHem-315a005913e4414db93e17de8e29367d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=3><p>Available in a wide range of sizes, made from recycled materials, and designed to lift and sculpt, this pair of jeans does it all.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After chatting with multiple stylists, one thing was clear: Good American denim is a force to be reckoned with. For those with fuller thighs, the Good Waist collection functions like a waist trainer but wears like a normal pair of jeans. The specially designed waistband cinches around your middle without annoying gapping in the back. For celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Kat Eves</a>, Good American has become a go-to when dressing her clients. “I love that you can choose which size model you want to see when you shop on the website,” she says. “I wish more brands understood how important this is to their success in selling to plus size customers, and really, anyone who is above a size 6!”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Lengths: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes:</strong> 00-30<strong> </strong>| <strong>Washes:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-hm-conscious-wide-high-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Value</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>H&M Conscious Wide High Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=2304 data-sizes=750px alt="H&amp;amp;M Conscious Wide High Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xbETaEzGOrTYD2Ky9_8FrBo304A=/fit-in/1500x2304/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/HMConsciousWideHighJeans-d16d1b741eee4d60a5a531079e987f2b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>H&M</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Brooklyn-based celebrity stylist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Joiee Thorpe</a>, H&M Conscious Denim is a hidden gem for jeans. Available in six washes, including dark gray and white denim, these wide leg pants deliver a laid back feel. Thorpe suggests styling with a blazer and bra top to spice things up or an oversized sweatshirt for something more casual. While we love their effortless look, these jeans have a longer inseam (around 30 inches), so petite ladies may have to get them hemmed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Lengths: </strong>1 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> 0-20<strong> </strong>| <strong>Washes:</strong> 6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-redone-comfort-stretch-high-rise-stove-pipe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RE/DONE Comfort Stretch High Rise Stove Pipe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RE/DONE Comfort Stretch High Rise Stove Pipe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/w_qafTfhTdPmP5zhPFv0ZHbC9Mg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/redone-comfort-stretch-high-rise-stove-pipe-18758eb2e1a4497c921c9e88c2551fd7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dreamt up in Los Angeles, the stylish yet simple denim brand was inspired by giving new life to luxury, heritage brands. Initially, they repurposed classic men’s Levi’s into more modern fits. Their first drop was so popular that it sold out almost immediately, and the brand was born. A favorite of editors and stylists alike, Thorpe recommends Re/Done for their cinched waists and smoothing, structured denim. While not every style will work for wide hips, this ’70s inspired high rise offers a little more room wrapped into a classic fit that is made to last.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Lengths: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes:</strong> 23-32<strong> </strong>| <strong>Washes:</strong> 10</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mid-rise-levis-premium-711-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mid-Rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi’s Premium 711 Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=982 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi&amp;acirc;s Premium 711 Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1zB_6sGmZg-p_TRrnKRyt4TyKgE=/fit-in/1500x982/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LevisPremium711SkinnyJeans-0ece0d4913114ced9d3c1415fa355877.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Levi's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For jeans, the higher the rise usually equals a better fit. We love high-rise cuts for their waist cinching abilities, but mid-rise are the secret weapon of the denim world. The waistline is designed to flatten and the fabric is made to sculpt. Not to mention, it works with just about every top. Made with a higher percentage of stretch than most of Levi's other styles, this jean is designed to love your curves. Available in four lengths and five washes, this option has something for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Lengths: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes:</strong> 24-34 | <strong>Washes:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flare-warp--weft-mia-high-rise-flare></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flare</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Warp + Weft Mia High-Rise Flare</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1030 data-sizes=750px alt="Warp + Weft Mia High-Rise Flare" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4uKDH3KvcKUwkrh6StyrUaThSyI=/fit-in/1500x1030/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/WarpWeftMiaHigh-RiseFlare-2058552d6e2b4cc3af77346362e707f5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Warp + Weft</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Flares can sometimes intimidate those with thick thighs, but our stylists love how they can elongate legs when properly fitted. For Eves, Warp and Weft is her go-to for flares, especially this specific style which she owns herself. “If you have thick thighs and calves, you may struggle to find vintage-style flares that bell out at the right spot,” she says. “The Mia High-Rise hit just right, though: No saggy bottoms here! With minimal stretch but still comfortable wear, these jeans maintain their shape over time, too.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Lengths: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes:</strong> 00-14 | <strong>Washes:</strong> 7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-straight-leg-abercrombie--fitch-curve-love-ultra-high-rise-90s-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Straight Leg</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch Ultra High Rise 90s Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch Curve Love Ultra 90s High Rise Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qzt5hmYhCHHGfI_IQi7Dlsq7ydM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Abercrombie--Fitch-Curve-Love-Ultra-90s-High-Rise-Straight-Jeans-0e6926a06f334e0b86747b9b979b7e0f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Abercrombie has made a comeback. Chances are you’ve seen this pair pop up on your favorite style blogger’s Instagram feed. Sure, the criss-cross waist creates an hourglass effect and the built-in stretch adds extra comfort, but the extra two inches through the hip and thigh is the real star. But don’t just take my word for it — New York City-based stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Audree Lopez </a>swears by Abercrombie's Curve Love line. “It is good quality for a more affordable price point,” she says, “but my favorite call out is that they have length options ranging from extra short to extra long which is great for all heights.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Lengths: </strong>5 | <strong>Sizes:</strong> 23W-37W<strong> </strong>| <strong>Washes:</strong> 20</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-stretch-nydj-waist-match-relaxed-flared-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Stretch</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NYDJ Relaxed Flared Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1200 data-sizes=750px alt="NYDJ Waist-Match Relaxed Flared Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8H3EvySoGRu0vJnWHMx90FM95DQ=/fit-in/1500x1200/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/NYDJWaist-MatchRelaxedFlaredJeans-113139e11f584601a6969691a7074dca.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>NYDJ</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">NYDJ stands for Not Your Daughter’s Jeans, meaning they aren’t ripped, rigid, or risque. These jeans are so stretchy they almost feel like leggings, but, unlike leggings, they have both a zipper and pockets. Lopez recommends these for a no frills, everyday pair of pants. Comfortability aside, we do wish there were more washes available as there’s currently only a light, dark, and a cream color on the site.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Lengths: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes:</strong> XXS-XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Washes:</strong> 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sustainable-unspun-feminine-slim-fit-space-blue-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sustainable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UnSpun Slim Fit Space Blue Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=2048 data-sizes=750px alt="UnSpun Feminine Slim Fit Space Blue Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Fv8ym0qWyqHDbHEkYZvS9QYOp-4=/fit-in/1500x2048/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/UnSpunFeminineSlimFitSpaceBlueJeans-a90ab7b5a48a4e3e8a32812b9898e9e1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>UnSpun</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What if there was a pair of jeans out there that fit your body perfectly, didn’t require sizing, and had a positive impact on the environment? Too good to be true? Not anymore. Instead of keeping warehouses full of inventory, Unspun makes every pair of jeans to order to eliminate excess waste. Eves calls Unspun “the future of denim.” The process is simple. Download their app, take a video of your full body, submit your measurements, choose your style, and then wait for your pair to arrive. This customization ensures a perfect fit even if you are wider in the hips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Lengths: </strong>N/A<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes:</strong> N/A | <strong>Washes:</strong> 2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curvier-figures-madewell-the-plus-curvy-perfect-vintage-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best For Curvier Figures</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Vintage Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1626 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Plus Curvy Perfect Vintage Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xq-5Lim6fcSw69yDUDiiacwBlNg=/fit-in/1500x1626/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MadewellThePlusCurvyPerfectVintageJean-bd707cb914444ceb8b944698287a10a7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another one of Lopez and Thorpe’s faves, this hip hugging style works with your curves instead of against them. The stretchy denim minimizes gapping, but holds its own enough to avoid the post-snack slump. With a couple extra inches built into the hips, your glutes get enough give.&nbsp;Bonus: This pair is made with recycled materials as well as less water than other jeans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Lengths: </strong>3<strong> </strong>| <strong>Sizes:</strong> 14W-28W<strong> </strong>| <strong>Washes:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Denim is made out of cotton, but many jeans are infused with stretch fabrics like elastane or polyester to increase flexibility. “The most important thing is to look for a little stretch in the denim,” says Lopez, “With a little extra give, you don't have to size up in order to fit jeans over your hips which helps avoid a large gap in the back.” Though many of the picks on this list are stretch, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Re/Done Comfort Stretch High Rise Stove Pipe</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">NYDJ Waist-Match Relaxed Flared Jeans</a> are two of the most comfortable.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rise<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">An easy rule of thumb: the higher the rise the better. Mid to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>high-rise jeans</a> usually taper in at the waist, eliminating the infamous waist gap.
