I can never seem to coordinate the round brush and blow dryer correctly, and I usually end up getting the brush caught in my hair, leaving behind a frizzy mess. That's why I've had my eye on the two-in-one <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Drybar Single Shot Round Blow-Dryer Brush</a> for a while now, and after finally trying it out, I can confidently say it lives up to the hype.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was lucky enough to receive the popular Drybar brush as a gift from the brand, so I immediately put it to the test. The styling tool has three temperature settings — cool, medium, and high — and a 2.25-inch round brush with both soft and stiff bristles. It's the perfect size and shape to create loose, lived-in waves.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's the run-down of my experience with the tool: After washing my hair, I applied <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sachajuan's Volume Cream</a> (another of my favorite hair products), sectioned off my locks, and started blow drying. I have fine hair, so after just one pass with the blow dryer brush, it was already smooth and shiny. I started off by pulling the brush down through my hair for a straight, sleek look. But as I got more confident, I twirled the front pieces around the brush as I pulled it down, which left me with effortless waves. I was immediately hooked.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that I've used the brush a few more times, I've gotten to a point where I can make my hair look like I just stepped out of a salon. I don't even need to use a flat iron or a curler after blow-drying my hair; the Drybar brush leaves it frizz-free on its own and gives my usually flat hair volume and lift at the roots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unsurprisingly, I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this multifunctional hair-styling tool. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One shopper said</a> it "gives [them] the most professional results in the least amount of time," adding that they have "perfect hair in less than 15 minutes." <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Another reviewer</a>, who bought the brush because they didn't want to "spend a fortune on the Dyson Airwrap," said the tool is "fast and easy and gets my hair straight."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take it from me: You don't have to be a skilled hair stylist to get amazing results with this tool. Grab the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Drybar Single Shot Blow-Dryer Brush</a> for $155 at Amazon to see for yourself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2eUp8ajrdFmqqKml6Gybr%2FHqKtmmpykxG6w0bKcq2WSp8K0tIyrnK%2Bhlaw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
