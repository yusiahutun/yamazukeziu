Zero dry time, long wear with no chips, and perpetually glossy shine. But all of these types of manis come with the potential to take a major toll on your nails — particularly if they're removed improperly. Or if you don't know how to strengthen nails after gel manicures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your weak, brittle nails are in need of a little extra TLC, listen up. Not all hope is lost. There are actually a handful of things you can do to get your nails back into tip-top shape. We rounded up pro tips from celebrity manicurists and nail experts (including their go-to nail strengtheners and supplements) to help your nails grow stronger and longer.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, learn how to get healthier nails after a gel manicure.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-remove-polish-correctly></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Remove Polish Correctly</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Okay, so technically this is a preventative measure. Do this first and it can save you from having to deal with a lot of potential problems in the first place. First and foremost, repeat after us: I will not pick off a gel manicure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Picking off gel is probably the worst thing you can do to your nails," says celebrity manicurist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Geraldine Holford</a>. In the short term, peeling off a gel manicure harms the nail plate since you're also peeling off the top layers of your nail. "The long-term effects are thinning of the nails, harm to the nail bed, and irregularities on the nail plate and in growth patterns."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Orly's Senior Product Testing Manager, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kelly Bannon</a>, agrees. Even if you soak your nails to remove the polish, you can still damage your nails if not soaked long enough or if the topcoat barrier is not broken, prohibiting the removal to reach all the gel layers. She strongly recommends having your gels removed by a professional to prevent any damage.</p><p>Whether you're having gel or dip removed, ask your tech to cover your hands in hot towels while your nails are wrapped up in the acetone-soaked cotton pads; the heat will help speed up the process.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hydrate-your-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hydrate Your Nails</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that the gel is off, the key is to moisturize. "Prolonged use of gel manis ... dehydrates your nails, making them dry, brittle, and fragile," says manicurist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jin Soon Choi</a>, founder of Jinsoon nail polish and salons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cuticle oil</a> is your BFF for imparting deep hydration. Focus on slathering it not only on the nail itself but also massaging it well into the cuticle. The cuticle is where new, healthy nail growth will start so it's important to nourish and hydrate this area, says Choi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One best-seller to try: <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>CND Solar Oil Nail and Cuticle Conditioner</a>. Holford also likes using straight-up <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>jojoba oil</a>, which can strengthen nail beds and boost healthy nail growth. She recommends applying it three times per day for five days (and keeping nails otherwise bare) for the best results.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-give-nails-a-break></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Give Nails a Break</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While there's no scientific evidence that keeping your nails polish-free will make a difference, anecdotally I can tell you that we totally notice a difference in the strength and health of the nails when our clients do take a break," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Gibson Tuttle</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Olive & June</a>. Choi and Holford agree — all three recommend keeping your nails au naturel for at least a few days after sporting a gel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you really need to keep them polished, use a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nail strengthener</a> as a base coat, suggests Holford. You can also look for a color that contains strengthening ingredients. (Keep reading for a list of some of our favorites below.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-consider-going-shorter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Consider Going Shorter</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Whether you realize it or not, when you have long nails, you're constantly hitting them on your keyboard, the door, you name it. People underestimate how much of an impact this has," says Tuttle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep your nails short and give them a chance to grow out stronger and healthier (and heck, maybe even longer) than before. The other upshot: Nails that aren't in great shape look healthier when they're shorter, adds Holford.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bannon adds that giving yourself a mini "manicure" — even if it's just as simple as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>filing your nails</a> — every two to four days can prevent breakage and snags. If your nails are really in need of some TLC, repeat these manis for two to four weeks to see results and stronger nails.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-strengthen-from-the-inside-out></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Strengthen From the Inside Out</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with addressing nails from the outside, all the experts we spoke with agreed that the right supplements can help strengthen your tips from the inside out. One good option? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Collagen</a>. An essential protein for hair, skin, and nails, ingestible collagen peptides are easily incorporated into your daily routine and can help promote healthy nails. "Collagen has really made a difference in the health of my nails. They feel resilient and stronger," says Holford. Try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>NeoCell Super Collagen Powder</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another good option? <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Biotin</a>. The B vitamin is one of Tuttle's top picks for strengthening nails. Choi adds that along with supplements, you can also incorporate biotin-rich and collagen-synthesizing foods — salmon, avocados, sweet potatoes, leafy greens, nuts, and seeds — into your diet.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-apply-a-nail-strengthener></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Apply a Nail Strengthener</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like we said above, a nail strengthener would be a great addition to your nail care regimen. It can help your nails grow strong, obviously, and this helps prevent breakage.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Orly Nailtrition</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Orly</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bannon recommends ending those aforementioned mini manicures with two coats of Orly's Nailtrition to strengthen damaged nails and promote growth.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Essie Treat Love & Color Nail Polish Strengthener</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Essie/Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If the idea of sporting bare nails is simply unfathomable, this line from Essie is a solid choice. The wide range of sheer colors is infused with strengthening collagen and camellia oil and can reduce peeling and breakage in just one week.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>OPI Nail Envy</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of OPI/Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Holford recommends this OPI pick, which she says is "transformative" for thin nails. You can use it on its own to strengthen nails (it remains clear and won't turn yellow), though, as mentioned, it works equally well as a base coat with benefits.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ten Over Ten Celery Oil</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Courtesy of The Celery Oil</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Celery juice is trending as an overall health booster, and this capitalizes on some of the same benefits ... for your nails. Celery seed extract improves thickness and minimizes the look of ridges, but this strengthening treatment also touts a long list of other beneficial ingredients. Vitamin B3 and zinc help harden nails and antioxidant-rich meadowfoam seed oil protects them from environmental damage.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Butter London Horse Power Nail Rescue Basecoat</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Courtesy of Butter London</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This treatment pairs biotin with horsetail extract (hence the name), another ingredient known for helping nails grow longer and stronger. While it works great on brittle nails, you can also swipe it on healthy tips for an added boost.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Olive & June Cuticle Serum Duo</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of Olive & June</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just like how a serum for your face is highly concentrated with beneficial ingredients, so is this option for your nails. Hydration is the name of the game, thanks to cactus flower, plus a blend of different oils such as jojoba, avocado, and apricot kernel. And, as we now know, hydrated nails mean longer, stronger nails.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6iuZqyfYsC1vsSnnq2glaN6r63IpapmmZapsrN5xp6jZm1jaoV1gJA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
