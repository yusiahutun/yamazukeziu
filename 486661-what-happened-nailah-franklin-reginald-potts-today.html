She was the daughter of Lee Franklin (father) and <a href=#>Maria</a> Maner (mother). Although she had four siblings, some of them were her stepsiblings. Nailah’s siblings are Lehia Franklin Acox, Marina Franklin, Ashlee Allen Gilot, and Ashley Chappell.</p><p class=align-left>Nailah’s father worked as a biochemist and businessman. Unfortunately, her parents divorced. However, she still maintained a <a href=#>close relationship</a> with all her siblings. Besides, her young siblings always looked up to her for advice because Nailah was easygoing.</p><p class=align-left>Nailah enrolled at the University of Illinois, a public research university in Illinois, Chicago. She graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Advertising. Her degree was prestigious enough to land her a job as a sales representative.</p><h2>What happened to Nailah?</h2><p class=align-left>Reginald Potts described himself as a <a href=#>real estate</a> investor. He presented himself to Nailah as a wealthy man with a lavish lifestyle. Some of his properties included a penthouse in the south loop, a Bentley, and other fancy cars. Nailah and Reginald Potts started seeing each other regularly. However, they were not exclusive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a54ec789bf389803.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who was Carl Judie and what happened to him? All the details</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In July 2007, one year after meeting him, Nailah broke up the relationship with Reginald. She began a new relationship with a man named Andre Wright. Nailah Franklin and Andre Wright met at an art gallery where she worked part-time. The only problem was that Andre lived in Milwaukee while Nailah resided in Chicago. Nevertheless, their relationship became more serious.</p><p class=align-left>Although Nailah was now in a relationship with Andre, she kept in touch with Reginald for a while. But Nailah started learning about Reginald’s past and present life. Then, on 16 July 2007, Nailah emailed Reginald that she tried removing him from her life but was unsuccessful because he always managed to slip back. Finally, however, she decided to end any communication with him.</p><p class=align-left>Before the emails, Nailah had hired a private detective to do a background check on Reginald. She discovered that Reginald was once imprisoned and engaged in other illegal activities. Furthermore, Reginald had at least three daughters, two with his ex-wife, and one was an infant.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6f53f5bcba5f86ad.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Kristina Wagner?

Furthermore, her interest in Reginald did not end. Nailah learned that Reginald was now flirting with some of her <a href=#>best friends</a>. She reached out to Reginald’s girlfriend, Ina, who had an infant and was looking for a house.</p><p class=align-left>Nailah and Ina shared information about Reginald and communicated on multiple occasions. Then, on 9 September 2007, someone emailed Nailah an article focusing on Reginald’s past, where he was arrested on drug and weapons charges. Nailah forwarded the article to her friends. But one mistake Nailah made was that she blind-copied it to Reginald.</p><p class=align-left>That resulted in threatening emails from Reginald. And after several days of exchanges, including Nailah telling Reginald she had filed for a<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> restraining order</a>, Nailah went to Wisconsin on 11 September to spend time with Andre. She returned and communicated with Ina, who also wanted a restraining order from Reginald. But on 18 September 2007, Nailah went missing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6313b9a5029f2d6a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Karima Jackson: Everything to know about Ice Cube's daughter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Her email was active throughout the day, sending it to multiple people, including Andre and her colleagues. Those that received the emails were curious because the tone did not sound like Nailah. On 19 September 2007, Andre filed a missing person’s report.</p><h2>Where is Reginald Potts today?</h2><p class=align-left>Reginald Potts became the main suspect based on her threatening conversations with Nailah. On 27 September 2007, the police found Nailah’s body in a wooded area behind a vacant Calumet City store owned by Potts’ brother-in-law.</p><p class=align-left>On 7 December 2007, the police arrested 30-year-old Reginald and charged him with first-degree murder. And after many years of delay, Reginald Potts’ trial started eight years later in<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Cook County Circuit Court</a>.</p><p class=align-left>In March 2016, a jury found Potts guilty, resulting in the presiding judge sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole for killing Nailah Franklin.</p><h2>Nailah Franklin’s net worth</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/97462ed706e465b9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Frances Cain?
